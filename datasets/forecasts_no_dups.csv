                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Thursday:</h2>
                <p>A front and upper trough should cross the Northwest on Thursday. This will cause southwest winds and increasing rain or snow with the rain or snow reaching the Olympics Thursday early morning and the Cascades Thursday late morning. This should result in new storm slab on a variety of slope aspects and new wind slab on lee slopes. These new storm and wind slab layers will build on a variety of previous snow surfaces including the scoured or icy surfaces at higher elevations and hoar frost, near surface facets or powder at lower elevations. So I would expect some potential dicey conditions out there by later Thursday.</p>

                <p>The most significant loading from new storm and wind slab will occur late Thursday afternoon through Friday morning at higher elevations. The new storm snow and wind deposited snow is expected to bond poorly to the variety of existing snow surfaces. Natural avalanche activity will likely be limited by the amount of loading on the newly buried weak layers and crusts. In areas that receive more wind transport and loading expect a higher likelihood of natural avalanches. Continued light showers and a warming trend during the day Friday will continue to stress the underlying snow. </p>

<p><strong>The snowpack is expected to be sensitive on Friday, mainly above treeline.</strong>  If venturing out into the backcounty on Friday, conservative trip planning and decision making in the field will be essential for safe travel. No reports of the quality or sensitivity of the bonding between new to old snow surfaces were available at the time of this forecast. </p>

<p>This stormmay test the strength and bonding of the near surface weak layers as well as introduce new storm slab instabilities.</p>

<p>The storm should begin with very cold temperatures Friday morning and this should deposit a layer of low density snow over a firm crust. Temperatures should rise through the afternoon along with increasing precipitation rates. This should build increasingly unstable storm slabs through the day causing an increase in the danger. By midday and through the afternoon there will be an increasing likelihood of triggered or possible natural slides, especially near and above treeline in areas receiving the heaviest precipitation.</p>

<p>The strong west to northwest crest level winds will also build unstable dense wind slab on lee slopes near ridges. </p>

<p>This storm should cause dangerous avalanche conditions near and above treeline where travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended by later Friday.  </p>

                <p>Light rain or snow showers should end Saturday morning giving way to mostly cloudy conditions. Moderate ridge top winds should persist Saturday. This should allow for slow settlement of newly formed unstable layers, however some new wind transport along ridges may maintain or continue to build wind slabs below ridges.</p>

<p>Expect to find a wide variety of local snow conditions and plan accordingly with flexibility in mind.</p>

<p><u><strong>Update Saturday morning</strong></u> - the Mt Hood Meadows ski patrol reports a 1"" thick freezing rain crust on Saturday morning throughout the ski area. This will be locking in the snowpack (and cause terrible skiing) and cause a low danger in that area. It is uncertain on Saturday morning how widespread the freezing rain was at Mt Hood. Any areas that have this crust should have a low avalanche danger.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Monday:</h2>
                <p>Quite a change is in store on Monday.</p>

<p>A strong cold front will cross the Northwest on Monday. This will cause strong west crest level winds, moderate to heavy rain changing to snow heaviest near and west of the crest, and cooling and lowering snow levels. These conditions should generally spread from the Olympics and north Cascades Monday early morning to the south Cascades Monday late morning to Mt Hood by Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>During the day on Monday this weather may build some new wind slab in the alpine and some shallower wind slab in near treeline areas on lee slopes. Remember that it can be difficult to determine where wind slab lies but it often has a chalky texture and may be triggered from thin areas near the edge of the slab. Storm slab seems more likely in mostly calmer below treeline areas especially where snowfall rates exceed about an inch per hour.</p>

<p>A high danger is not in the forecast mainly due to the expected cooling trend. But a considerable danger still means dangerous avalanche conditions.</p>

<p>In areas with light wind, where rain changes to snow, and with lower rates of loading, the cooling trend should help bond new snow to old snow and help build right side up conditions with lower density snow nearer the surface. This can mean some good skiing in those types of areas. Underlying wet snow in areas that has it should also begin to refreeze and strengthen.</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Shallow snow cover and shallow new snow will continue</span><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;""> to limit the avalanche danger at lower elevations</span><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">.</span></p>

<p>Remember this is a regional forecast and you must make your own on site evaluations to see if they are different than forecast.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Wednesday:</h2>
                <p>The ridge which has been around so much over the US west coast this month will build a bit and shift east over the Northwest on Wednesday. This should cause a day of partly cloudy or partly sunny weather and mild above freezing temperatures through the daylight hours in the Olympics and Cascades. This weather and the low sun angle should cause little change in snow conditions.</p>

<p>Watch for the isolated areas of wind slab in the alpine mainly near Washington Pass. For now this will be called wind slab but would be called persistent slab if the underlying faceted snow turns out to be long lived. This is most likely to be triggered in areas where the snow pack is thin and wind affected.</p>

<p>Most other areas should continue with shallow snow with alternating layers of crusts and rounded grains. Or little if any snow at all.</p>

<p>A front will begin to spread clouds and moisture to the area Wednesday night. Some mainly mid and high clouds may reach the Cascade east slopes mainly in the north part Wednesday night.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Thursday:</h2>
                <p>A change and some uncertainty is in store on Thursday.</p>

<p>A front will begin to reach the Olympics and north Cascades on Thursday afternoon. This should cause increasing southwest winds, increasing rain or snow and lowering snow levels. Snow levels Thursday afternoon should still be high enough to restrict snow to the alpine but up to several inches may be seen there by the end of the daylight hours. Therefore attention in the Olympics and north Cascades will shift to potential new wind and storm slab of several inches in the alpine starting Thursday afternoon. But the cooling and change in most areas from rain to snow should also favor shallow stable snow in many calm areas of the alpine. Rain near treeline or below treeline through Thursday afternoon should not greatly change conditions in those areas.</p>

<p>The uncertainty is due to timing of the storm. If snow arrives sooner or later and snow levels are higher or lower than expected then the expected snow and avalanche conditions would change as well.</p>

<p>The storm will move over the Northwest on Thursday night. This will cause further increasing winds and more snow at further lowering snow levels. The avalanche danger should further increase in the Olympics on Thursday night.</p>

<p>This weather will help to further gradually stabilize previous wind slab layers leading to an overall decreasing danger. But continue to watch for signs of wind transported snow near ridges or on specific terrain features such steep rollovers on Sunday especially in the alpine areas.</p>

<p>It will be sunny and warm enough that wet loose avalanches may also be seen on solar aspects. Watch for initial signs of damp loose snow such as wet surface snow deeper than a few inches, rollerballs or natural releases. Wet loose snow avalanche might be most likely in gullies and cirques receiving sun. But solar input is also at its least at this time of year so damp or wet snow should not be extensive.</p>

                <p>The forecast for Friday is a bit more complex than usual.</p>

<p>An occluded front should cross the Northwest Thursday afternoon and evening. This should cause continued west to southwest winds and more new snow by Friday morning east of the crest with a slight cooling trend. This should maintain similar conditions through Friday afternoon. Watch for wind slab on lee slopes mainly north to southeast aspects. Storm slab may be possible on more varied aspects. Less snow and lighter winds as well as continued low snow depths should cause less avalanche danger at lower elevations.</p>

<p>Persistent slab may be added to the forecast east of the crest in the north part if additional loading reveals more widespread sensitivity.</p>

<p>The complex part of the forecast comes Friday afternoon and evening which will be a period of rapid change. A very strong front is indicated to cross the Northwest on Friday night. Currently it looks like the strongest winds, heaviest rain or snow and main warming will mostly hold off through Friday afternoon and then begin Friday evening. The avalanche danger should greatly increase Friday night. Beware that if this system and these changes arrive sooner the avalanche danger could rapidly increase Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>A strong front will cross the Northwest on Friday night causing increasing moderate to heavy rain or snow and rising snow levels. A natural avalanche cycle seems possible on Friday night.</p>

<p>Stormy weather due to strong orographic west flow and heavy showers with lowering snow levels should be seen Saturday. The main concern during the day Saturday should be rapid snow loading and deep storm slab building especially in the alpine and near treeline and then to below treeline on many or most slopes. Rapid snow loading is generally accepted to mean more than 1' of snow per hour. Natural and triggered avalanche should be likely on Saturday.</p>

<p>Strong SW winds will veer to W behind the front later Saturday morning.  Expect rapid wind loading Friday night and throughout the day Saturday.  Strong winds should easily develop wind slab on lee slopes...and due to the strong winds wind loading will occur further downslope than during a more moderate event.   </p>

<p>Remember the danger ratings and icons are for the daylight hours. The avalanche danger should still be limited at the lowest elevations by shallow snow and terrain and vegetation.</p>

                <p>The steady stream of warm frontal precipitation will lift north Sunday night with only very light additional loading expected through the day. Westerly winds will strong be in the alpine, but additional wind loading should also be on the decrease due less available snow for transport and warmer temperatures. The greatest avalanche concerns will be from recent storm and wind loaded slopes that have not settled.  Considerable Danger will be in effect on Monday near and above treeline mainly for the lee slopes that are still sensitive due to the likelihood of human triggered slides.  Continue to choose your terrain and aspect wisely!</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Wet-loose avalanches are possible mainly near and below 5000 feet where above freezing temperatures and light rain may cause pin-wheeling and loose wet slides. </span></p>

                <p>Light winds, sunny weather and warm temperatures should be seen on Thursday. But the sun is still pretty weak less than a month after the solstice.</p>

<p>This weather should mainly cause layers to further consolidate and further stabilize. Watch for lingering cornices and areas of wind slab on lee slopes mainly in the alpine. This should be mainly on north to southeast facing slopes.</p>

<p>Warming and sunshine may lead to loose wet snow conditions on steep solar aspects.</p>

<p>Wet loose snow avalanches seem unlikely on Wednesday give all the recent consolidation, recent wet loose avalanche activity, cooler temperatures and potential high clouds and will not be listed as a concern.

<p>Wet loose avalanches seem even less likely at Mt Hood on Monday due to recent consolidation, increasing high clouds and cooler temperatures and will not be listed as a concern on Monday. But avoid steep solar aspects or gullies in the sun if you seen natural wet loose avalanches or wet surface snow deeper than a few inches.</p>

<p><strong>Local non-avalanche hazards:  </strong>Thinner than usual crevasse bridges have been noted in the Washington Cascades. Don't assume that crevasses have the usual relatively thick bridges during this so far shallow snow season.</p>

                <p>Generally decreasing light to occasionally moderate snow showers at further cooling temperatures along with diminishing winds are expected Thursday.   The cool temperatures should preserve any existing weak layers within storm snow as well as layers such as buried surface hoar or weak bonding between old and new snow. </p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Thursday:</h2>
                <p>Fair weather should be seen Thursday but with continued very cold temperatures. Increasing clouds and light snow should be seen by Thursday afternoon. The cold temperatures will maintain or increase any weaknesses and layers in the snowpack</p>

<p>The main concern will be small old areas of wind slab on previous lee slopes. This should be most likely north to southeast aspects above treeline.</p>

<p>Moderate avalanche danger specifically means that natural avalanches have become unlikely but human triggered avalanches are possible in specific areas and terrain features.</p>

<p>Further increasing winds and snowfall should increase the avalanche danger on Thursday night.</p>

                <p>A weather system off the Oregon coast late Saturday spread northeastwards across the Mt Hood area and into the southern WA Cascades late Saturday and should produce moderate to heavy snowfall totals through Sunday morning.  Increasing wind transport should be seen Sunday shifting to more widespread terrain as winds shift and increase.  Another disturbance moving onshore later Sunday should spread increasing snowfall and strong ridgetop winds to most areas.  This should build more widespread storm slabs and begin to load a variety of weak <span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">critical </span><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">surface snow </span><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">layers such as surface hoar, near surface faceted snow or weak low density snow deposited with light winds and cold temperatures. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;""> </span><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">  </span><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;""> </span></p>

<p>More significant new snow amounts are likely on Mt Hood along with strong winds.  This should cause widespread sensitive human triggered slab avalanches becoming increasingly likely.  Watch also for some east facing ridges or slopes that have have had surface snow scoured to the late Jan crust.  New storm snow may bond poorly to any exposed hard crust layers.</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Manage the terrain by avoiding freshly wind loaded lee slopes near and below tree-line. Watch for shooting cracks as a sign of </span>instability<span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">. Even a small wind slab in the wrong terrain, i.e. above cliffs or very steep slopes, could have unintended </span>consequences<span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">.</span></p>

<p>These conditions should cause very dangerous avalanche conditions above tree line Sunday, where travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended. </p>

<p>The main concerns should be new storm slab on a variety of slope aspects and wind slab mainly on lee aspects from Monday and Monday night.

Slabs may also be more reactive where they slide on the January crust or scoured surfaces.</p>

<p>Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended above tree-line Tuesday. If you travel near tree-line or below tree-line watch for signs of wind transport and loading on lee slopes. Shooting cracks are always a sign of instability. Even a small wind or storm slab in the wrong terrain such as above cliffs or above steep slopes can have unintended consequences.</p>

<p>Limited snow at the lowest elevations will limit the avalanche danger especially on solar aspects. The mid and base pack should still consist of mostly stable crust and melt form layers from periods of warm weather earlier this winter.</p>

Sustained cold tempeartures last week lead to new </span><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">surface hoar formation, near surface faceting and preserved the generally light amounts of low density snow that fell during last week.  The cold weather also helped to break down crusts in the upper snowpack. Moderate east winds late last week helped form touchy wind slabs.   </span><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;""> </span></p>, '\n\n', <p>Generally 2 - 4 inches of water weight has been added to the snowpack on the west slopes, with 1 to 2.5 ft of new, higher density snow. The higher amounts were seen at Mt. Baker and upper Alpental and Stevens NWAC stations.  Natural avalanches Monday night and again Tuesday night were reported throughout the west slopes with the exception of near Crystal Mtn.  In the near and above treeline zones, colder temperatures and strong westerly winds transported new snowfall and built new wind slab on lees slopes.  A period of easterly flow at Stevens and Snoqualmie Passes helped crossload slopes before a switch to westerly Wednesday morning. </p>, '\n\n', <p>Near Mt. Baker, Mt. Baker ski patrol reported a natural cycle down below 5000' with the warming and slides up to 2'.  Some slides reached SR 542 Tuesday night. Alpental ski patrol reported a healthy avalanche cycle Tuesday night as well throughout their uncontrolled terrain with most slides initiated within the new storm snow but reaching down to a localized freezing rain crust was formed Sunday, 2/9.  Perhaps the trickiest snowpack continues to be in and near the Stevens Pass area.  DOT professionals reported slides 1-2.5 ft with control work Tuesday morning failing on faceted crystals just above the late Jan crust.  A similar weak layer was involved in a skier triggered avalanche on Big Chief Mtn just outside the ski area boundary Tuesday afternoon around 5000 ft on a NW aspect and resulted in an injury.  NWAC observer Jeff Ward has a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mw7xQgL4eY&amp;feature=youtu.be"">great video</a> from Tuesday demonstrating the touchy new storm slab failing on near surface facets and triggering a remote slide near Stevens Pass near treeline and of high quality shears for an increasingly deeply buried layer of surface hoar at lower elevations on a north aspect.   </p>, '\n\n', <p><em>Note the avalanche danger is locally lower in the Crystal Mountain and south region and over in the Olympics where there has been less new snow and due to reports of better bonding between old and new snow surfaces in the Crystal Mountain area. </em></p>, '\n\n', <p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.nwac.us/media/uploads/2014/02/11/20140210 Mt Baker Lyle Haugsven.jpg"" style=""line-height: 1.6em; width: 300px; height: 225px;""/></p>, '\n\n', <p><em>NWAC observer Jeff Hambelton sent this photo of a storm slab triggered on a test slope at Mt Baker from 10 Feb.</em></p>, '\n\n', <p>Limited snow at the lowest elevations will limit the avalanche danger there.

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Thursday:</h2>
                <p>A slightly weaker front should cross the area Wednesday night through Thursday morning with an uptick of west to southwest winds during this time period as well. </p>

<p>Warmer temperatures and a relative break in new loading Wednesday afternoon helped new storm snow instabilities settle, but new loading Wednesday night will reintroduce new storm and wind slab.  </p>

<p>Rain at lower elevations will also load and weaken surface snow layers and may cause wet loose avalanches in the lower below treeline zone, likely below 3500 ft.</p>

<p>Natural avalanches will be less likely on Thursday, but large avalanches in specific areas sensitive to skier/rider triggering remains likely.</p>

<p>With the passing of each storm system, the possibility of deeper and more dangerous slabs grows for slopes that have not yet avalanched, potentially releasing to or entraining snow down to near the late Jan crust.  Exercise caution tomorrow and through the rest of the storm cycle by choosing more conservative terrain.    </p>

<p>Note the avalanche danger is locally lower in the Crystal Mountain and south region and over in the Olympics. </p>

This system should have cooler temperatures and lower snow levels than the past few systems. Rapid loading should begin to cause new storm slab to begin to build on most sheltered aspects in all the elevations zones Sunday afternoon. Wind transport should cause new wind slab to begin to build on lee slopes mainly near and above treeline. This will begin to add further loads to the rain crust from Wednesday or deep layers. Natural or triggered large avalanches should become possible Sunday midday.</p>

<p>The storm should peak in the Olympics Sunday afternoon and evening. Rapid loading and wind transport will cause storm and wind slab to further build and become deep Sunday afternoon and evening.

During the last week and the half Mt. Hood has been pummeled almost daily by frontal systems producing periods of strong winds and intense snowfall accumulation.  Snow levels started out quite low during this cycle but over the last week have fluctuated and settled at more moderate levels.  </p>, '\n\n', <p>Water equivalents in the Mt.

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Tuesday:</h2>
                <p>Another fast moving and powerful storm system will impact the Pacific Northwest on Tuesday.  Snowfall will increase first in the Olympics Tuesday morning and spread into Mt. Hood by late morning.  A more southerly flow out ahead of frontal boundary should bring rapid loading rates first to more northerly aspects and then during and following the frontal passage to more traditional easterly aspects as winds veer to more westerly by Tuesday afternoon. A warm-up preceding the frontal passage should cause rain at lower elevations in the below treeline zone and form denser wind and storm slab elsewhere.  </p>

<p>New storm slab will form on all sheltered aspects above 4500 feet. New potentially deep wind slab will develop on lee N thru SE slopes. Natural or triggered avalanches will be likely at all elevations. Direct action avalanches that release initially in storm layers seem likely to step down to deeper layers. Wet loose avalanches should become more likely in the afternoon below 4500 feet and may entrain large amounts of the most recent storm snow. </p>

<p>Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended on Tuesday.</p>

This layer is still failing in deep column tests and showing a propensity to propagate. While unlikely that a skier's weight would trigger avalanches this deep, cornices have grown very large over the last week and could be the natural trigger needed to release deeper slides. Since this layer continues to be found, particularly in the northeast Cascades...the persistent slab concern has been changed to deep persistent slab.

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Wednesday:</h2>
                <p>Competing factors on Wednesday will keep dangerous avalanche conditions in play despite a relative break in the storm cycle and a favorable temperature trend.  A cooling trend overnight Tuesday and continuing on Wednesday should build lower density snow on top of Tuesday's soft storm slab and allow new storm instabilities to slowly settle. An exception may be found locally in persistent heavy showers slopping east of the crest near a<span style=""line-height: 1.6em;""> convergence zone expected to form near Stevens Pass tonight and eventually shift south toward Snoqualmie Pass mid-day where new loading may stress the most recent storm layer </span>instabilities<span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">. In addition moderate westerly winds will continue to load lee easterly aspects throughout the day Wednesday. South to southeast winds ahead of Tuesday's frontal system near the passes may have cross loaded slopes before winds switched to westerly so NW aspects have been added to the wind slab concern.  </span></p>

<p>Expect snow conditions to still be touchy on Wednesday and human triggered avalanches will be likely mainly on lee NW thru SE aspects at all elevations. Triggered avalanches are likely to start and stay in the new snow from yesterday...but the potential exists for very large avalanches in specific areas that release down to stiffer wind slab layers or buried persistent weak layers described in the forecast discussion. Recently formed and sensitive cornices along ridgelines are an example of a natural trigger that could be large enough to trigger a much deeper and very destructive slide.  Shallow snowpack areas increase the likelihood of a skier's weight collapsing a buried persistent weak layer and having the fracture propagate across the slope.  </p>

<p>Stick with conservative terrain choices for another day and let all the recent snow and associated water weight received over the last week a chance to settle.  </p>

                <p>Northwest flow will help carry a weak low pressure system northwest to southeast across the Olympics and Washington Cascades on Saturday. At Mt Hood this should cause west northwest winds but with little if any snow and cool temperatures. This should cause little change in snow and avalanche conditions.</p>

<p>Layers from the past 11 days should partly stabilize. Possible older deeper wind slab may linger on previous lee slopes mainly at higher elevations. Watch for signs of firmer wind transported snow.</p>

<p>Previous older deeper storm slab on sheltered slopes should be mostly stabilized and unlikely by Saturday.</p>

<p>The sun is starting to get stronger as we head toward March. Watch for sun effects such as roller balls and pinwheels on solar slopes that could trigger a loose wet avalanche or a wind or storm slab layer on a steep slope.</p>

Luckily no on was injured in this potentially deadly avalanche with a 10' crown.  It is believed this slide was initiated by a smaller slide or possible cornice failure then stepped down to the deep layer. This avalanche paired with the frequent and large results from ski patrol should steer the discussion to terrain management of low probability and high consequence slides that release down to old storm layers or the late Jan crust.</p>, '\n\n            ', <div class=""forecast-detailed"">
                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Wednesday:</h2>
                <p>Expect snow conditions in the Snoqualmie Pass area to remain similar to Tuesday as cool east winds should maintain near or sub-freezing temperatures helping to maintain that ice crust on most slopes.  </p>

<p>Human triggered large or very large avalanches have become unlikely but are still high consequence if able to step down to poorly bonded previous storm layers or buried persistent weak layers. Cornices have grown large and may be sensitive. A cornice failure could provide a large enough natural trigger to trigger a large and destructive avalanche.  Avoid areas in avalanche terrain where you believe the snowpack to be shallower and potentially easier to trigger a deep PWL. </p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Saturday:</h2>
                <p>Significant cooling is expected Friday night and Saturday with mostly cloudy conditions and light snow showers expected Saturday. This weather should cause the previously wet surface and upper snow layer to re-freeze, forming a hard and supportable crust.  The surface or near surface crust should limit the avalanche potential, especially near and below tree line.  Shallow new snow received Saturday should not appreciably increase the danger, however some strengthening winds may begin to form shallow new storm layers on some lee slopes at higher elevations by late Saturday.  </p>

<p>In areas where the forming surface crust has significant surface roughness, this may help new snow bonding.  However the rapidly dropping temperatures expected Friday night ahead of the onset of precipitation Saturday may counter that in many areas where poor bonding may develop.</p>

<p>The strengthening new surface crust expected Saturday should cause generally safe avalanche conditions.  However continue to watch for unstable snow on isolated terrain features, especially above treeline.  Also watch for recently formed large cornices along ridges and give them a wide birth and safety margin. <span style=""line-height: 1.6em;""> </span>Some<span style=""line-height: 1.6em;""> of these cornices have grown large over the last 2 weeks and a cornice failure could provide a large enough load to trigger a large avalanche. </span></p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Saturday:</h2>
                <p>A warm and moist frontal system will impact the Pacific Northwest over the weekend. Light rain and snow should begin in the north Cascades Saturday morning and become heavy in the afternoon along with increasing southwest winds. Light rain and snow should develop by the late morning for the central and south Washington Cascades and not become heavy until the late afternoon and evening.</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Steep slopes that recently received heavy snowfall should be primed for wet loose avalanches, especially when loaded with rain Saturday. Natural pinwheeling of surface snow is usually a precursor to this type of avalanche. Expect wet loose avalanches to potentially entrain moist and unconsolidated snow at near and below treeline and could make for a large and destructive wet snow avalanche in specific areas. Lower density storm snow at higher elevations received during the week will be in play for loose wet avalanches by Saturday afternoon. If you are sinking in more than ankle deep, expect wet loose avalanches to be possible on steeper slopes. With the continuing warm temperatures, cornices are still expected to be sensitive so give them a wide berth when traveling along ridgelines. </span></p>

<p>Dense storm and wind slab should begin to develop mainly in the above treeline zone (depending on the snow level) Saturday. Despite a favorable temperature trend, heavy loading rates will likely lead to storm snow instabilities. Strong SW winds will build dense and large wind slab on lee slopes Saturday afternoon and night. </p>

<p><strong>The north Cascades and Olympics have a higher danger related to more quickly escalating avalanche danger Saturday.</strong> <strong>T</strong><strong style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">he avalanche forecast is for the daylight hours (through 6 pm) but deteriorating avalanche conditions are expected Saturday night with natural avalanches becoming likely as heavy rain reaches into the above treeline zone and loads recently formed storm slabs at higher elevations. </strong></p>

                <p>Another potential major wet loose avalanche cycle is likely during frontal passage and heavy rain or snow at warmer temperatures Saturday afternoon and night. Cornice failures are also likely during that period.</p>

<p>But rain or snow showers decrease rapidly on Sunday morning at slightly cooler temperatures. Significant new snow is not expected or should be very limited. A decreasing avalanche danger is expected on Sunday.</p>

                <p>A moderate cold front will approach from the west Thursday night and cross the Northwest on Friday morning. This will be accompanied by increasing winds, moderate rain or snow and slightly lowering snow levels. Showers following the front should decrease Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>New wind slab is likely on lee slopes. You should be most likely to trigger a wind slab on north to southeast aspects near and above treeline. Watch for signs of firmer wind transported snow or cracking snow.</p>

<p>New storm slab is also likely on sheltered slopes again mainly near and above treeline. This is most likely in any areas that receive an inch of snow or more an hour for at least a few hours.</p>

<p>It is now March and the sun is getting stronger. Watch for sun effects on new snow mainly on solar aspects but possibly aspects as well. Wet loose avalanches are becoming more likely if you see pinwheels or initial small natural wet loose releases.</p>

<p>In sheltered areas where the winds are not strong and the snowfall not heavy the increase in avalanche danger should be more limited. In such areas the cooling trend may also help create right side up layering with lower density snow near the surface.</p>

                <p>The strong front across the WA Cascades Sunday should shift south over the Mt Hood area overnight bringing  a period of moderate to heavy snow and strong winds.  This should build new wind slab on lee terrain near and especially above treeline. The bonds of new snow to a refreezing crust should be good given the slow cooling trend.  </p>

<p>A cool upper trough should pass the Cascades early Monday with cool but drying northwesterly flow expected through the day Monday.  A few light snow showers early Monday should give way to partly to mostly cloudy conditions with increasing and strong northwest winds lasting through the day.</p>

<p>This weather should allow for the older wet snow to form a more solid underlying crust which may act as a sliding surface.  The strong winds should transport recent snow, mainly above treeline but look for transported snow near tree line as well.  Winds should shift to more northwesterly Monday so watch for wind slab formation on east to south facing slopes.  </p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Storm slabs should begin to slowly </span>stabilize Monday but should remain a concern and expect triggered slides to remain likely on steeper open terrain where cautious route-finding and conservative decision making will be essential. <span style=""line-height: 1.6em;""> </span></p>

<p>A modest warming Tuesday afternoon should lead to minor loose wet concerns on all aspects.  Small point releases on steeper slopes have a fair bit of new and consolidated snow to entrain and would be the most problematic around terrain traps.  Storm slab avalanches should be still be possible given the reports of poor bonding to the old snow surface. </p>

<p>Generally soft wind slab at higher elevations may still be sensitive, and we advise the most caution when traveling at higher and more open avalanche terrain that may be wind loaded and where colder temperatures should preserve lingering instabilities.  Watch for cracking in the snow surface and for signs of obvious wind transport such as scoured lee ridges with wind slab extending well into the near treeline zone.  </p>

                <p>Partly cloudy conditions are expected Friday with continued cool weather and generally light winds. This should allow for slow stabilization of the recent wind and storm slabs that will be most likely found on lee <span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">north to east slopes near and above treeline. Watch for cracking or firmer wind transported snow.</span></p>

<p>New shorter lived storm slab should also be possible on a wider variety of slopes mainly near and above treeline. </p>

<p>The equinox is near and the sun is gaining power. Despite the cool temperatures and low snow levels wet loose avalanches may be possible on Sun exposed terrain, especially mid and lower elevations. Watch for wet surface snow deeper than a few inches, pinwheels, and natural wet loose releases that usually precede more major wet loose snow avalanches.</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">The equinox has passed and we've officially moved into spring; wet loose avalanches remain possible on sun exposed terrain especially in the late morning and afternoon hours. Watch for wet surface snow deeper than a few inches, pinwheeling of surface snow and small natural wet loose releases that usually precede more major wet loose snow avalanches. Wet loose avalanches may be larger and entrain more snow than over the weekend due to the warmer temperatures and sun, and could in isolated areas step down to lingering slab </span>instabilities<span style=""line-height: 1.6em;""> weakened my meltwater in the upper snowpack.  </span></p>

Unconsolidated new snow found in the morning may become a slab with day-time warming...even on cool spring days. Be aware of intense precipitation rates on Saturday during heavier showers that could lead to new storm snow instabilities or unstable graupel layers. Wind or storm slab on higher lee slopes near and above treeline have not had enough time to settle out. Watch for signs of cracking or firmer wind transported snow and approach open lee slopes with caution.   </p>

<p>Despite mostly cloudy skies Saturday,  wet loose concerns are still possible at lower elevations especially on steeper slopes in the afternoon. <span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Watch for wet surface snow deeper than a few inches, roller balls in surface snow and small natural wet loose releases that usually precede more major wet loose snow avalanches.  Even brief sunbreaks could quickly extend the wet loose concern to higher elevation solar aspects.  Avoid terrain traps where a small but powerful wet loose avalanche could have unintended </span><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">consequences</span><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">. </span></p>

                <p>A weak vertically aligned low pressure system should drop south over the northeast Pacific Ocean and Northwest coastal waters Sunday night and Monday. This should cause decreasing winds with partly cloudy weather at Mt Hood.

<p>Watch for areas of recent wind slab on lee slopes. This is likely on shaded north to east slopes near and above treeline. Watch for signs of cracking or firmer wind transported snow and approach open lee slopes with caution.</p>

<p>Recent storm slab may need another day to stabilize on Monday. This would be found on sheltered slopes where there was recent heavy snowfall or graupel which may have formed temporary weaker storm layers. This possible shorter lived concern might still be found on Monday above treeline due to cooler temperatures there.</p>

<p>Remember to watch for cornices if you venture onto ridges on Monday and avoid slopes below cornices. Cornice failures are normally seen during the transition to spring weather.</p>

                <p>A slow moving weak cold front will cross the Northwest Thursday afternoon and evening. This will cause increasing winds and increasing rain or snow. A weak upper short wave, cooler air mass and mostly light showers should follow across the Northwest on Friday. New snow amounts should be mostly light east of the crest. Up to a few inches might be seen near and above treeline by Friday morning.</p>

<p>Watch for new mostly shallow wind slab which should be possible on lee slopes. This should be mainly north to southeast slopes near and above treeline. <span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Watch for signs of cracking or firmer wind transported snow and approach open lee slopes with caution.</span></p>

<p>Shallow new storm slab seems unlikely but would be found on more sheltered slopes above treeline. This will be only in areas that receive at least a few inches of snow. Storm slab forms where bonds are poor to previous snow or where wind or where temperature changes create temporary weak storm layers.</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Cool temperatures and lack of new snow should limit the threat of wet loose avalanches east of the crest but it will be listed as an unlikely concern near and above treeline.

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Saturday:</h2>
                <p>A front with increasing clouds and moisture will move to the Northwest Saturday afternoon and night. This is expected to cause increasing winds and increasing rain and snow with slightly rising snow levels first in the Olympics Saturday early afternoon and in the Cascades Saturday late afternoon. The timing and strength of this system will be important for avalanche concerns on Saturday. If the system arrives sooner than expected then new wind slab and storm slab will begin to form sooner in the day. If the system arrives later or weaker then significant new wind slab and storm slab may not form before the end of the daylight hours.</p>

<p>After solar effects, avalanches and consolidation today and overnight cooling tonight the avalanche danger will be lower Saturday morning.</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Clouds should increase over the Cascades on Saturday and cut down on solar effects compared to Friday. So wet loose avalanche activity should be less on Saturday. But wet loose avalanches will be listed as possible on Saturday. This should be mainly on solar slopes near and above treeline. Watch for natural avalanches, pinwheels and surface wet snow deeper than a few inches on any solar slope.</span></p>

<p>The formation of new wind slab as mentioned above depends on the timing and strength of the incoming system. The formation of new small wind slab on lee slopes is expected to be possible by the end of the daylight hours east of the crest. This should be mainly north to southeast slopes near and above treeline. <span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Watch for signs of cracking or firmer new wind transported snow and approach open lee slopes with caution.</span></p>

<p>The formation of new storm slab as mentioned above also depends on the timing and strength of the incoming system. The formation of new small storm slab is also expected to be possible by the end of the daylight hours east of the crest. This should be mainly on sheltered slopes near and above treeline in areas that receive more than a few inches of snow by the end of the day. Storm slab forms where bonds are poor to previous snow or where wind or where temperature changes create temporary weak storm layers.</p>

                <p>High pressure will build over the PNW on Monday with mostly sunny skies expected in the Mt. Hood area.  Freezing levels will pop up on Monday and be accompanied by generally light winds. In addition, mild temperatures overnight and variable cloud cover will likely prevent the wet near surface snow from a good re-freeze.</p>

<p>The potential for wet snow avalanches should quickly ramp up Monday with high freezing levels and will not be confined only to solar slopes. </p>

<p>New storm snow instabilities from Saturday night should have settled out, but above 5000 feet, small wet point releases will have the ability to become larger and more dangerous as they entrain new snowfall from Saturday night.  Watch for wet surface snow deeper than a few inches, roller balls in surface snow and small natural wet loose releases that usually precede more major wet loose snow avalanches.  Avoid terrain traps where a small but powerful wet loose avalanche could have unintended consequences. </p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Tuesday:</h2>
                <p>An approaching frontal system on Tuesday should spread increasing clouds and precipitation from the north Cascades to the central and south Cascades in the afternoon. Southwest winds should increase in advance of the front. Snow/freezing levels will remain quite mild on Tuesday.  Expect wet snow surface conditions and the possibility for wet loose avalanches to be enhanced during periods of moderate rain fall in the north Cascades and by stronger solar effects during the first half of Tuesday over the south Cascades.  Overall, increasing winds and cloud cover and cooler temperatures in the afternoon should lower the likelihood for wet loose avalanches a notch Tuesday, but remember the recipe for human triggered slides is still intact in the wrong terrain. </p>

<p>Watch for wet surface snow deeper than a few inches, roller balls in surface snow and small natural wet loose releases that usually precede more major wet loose snow avalanches.  Avoid terrain traps where a small but powerful wet loose avalanche could have unintended consequences. </p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Continue to be wary of cornices Tuesday and avoid traveling on slopes below them.  Cornice failures are often seen during the transition to spring weather. Cornices have grown large recently and often break back further from the edge than </span>expected<span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">. </span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Shallow new storm slab should begin to build in the above treeline zone for the north Cascades Tuesday, especially on higher lee slopes. </span></p>

<p>Natural or triggered wet loose avalanches seem possible and more extensive than other concerns on Sunday. The late April sun can be counted on to act on new snow deeper that a couple inches on any steep solar slope. This will be mainly in the ATL and NTL zones.

<p>Small new areas of wind slab from Saturday also seem possible on lee slopes. This will mainly be on north to southeast slopes in the ATL zone. <span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Watch for signs of firmer wind transported snow or cracking snow.</span></p>

                <p>A warm front will move across the Northwest on Wednesday night followed by the cold front Thursday morning. This will cause southwest winds and further moderate to heavy rain and snow especially from Mt Rainier to Mt Hood. Snow levels should rise to the 4000 foot, 5000 foot and 6000 foot range in the north, central and south Cascades respectively on Wednesday night. Snowfall in the ATL and NTL zones for the 48 hours ending Thursday morning should be in the .5-1 foot range from Mt Baker to Snoqualmie and in the 2-3 foot range from Mt Rainier to Mt Hood. Less snowfall is likely east of the crest.</p>

<p>Southwest winds and moderate to heavy showers should be seen following the front on Thursday morning. Further southwest winds and generally moderate showers should be seen Thursday afternoon. Snow levels should lower a bit to about 4000 feet in the north and 5000 feet in the south following the cold front.</p>

<p>New snow will be very susceptible to strong spring solar effects and strong daytime warming! New or further building storm and wind slab will also be seen. These avalanche concerns will be especially where snowfall is expected to be heaviest from Mt Rainier to Mt Hood.</p>

<p>The avalanche concerns will be listed as very likely from Mt Rainier to Mt Hood, likely at Hurricane and from Mt Baker to Snoqualmie, and possible east of the crest.</p>

                <p>New snowfall received Saturday night and Sunday may bond poorly to thin melt-freeze/sun crusts found at lower elevations and solar aspects. Heavier showers Sunday will promote storm instabilities within the new snow.  More snowfall is expected near and south of Mt. Rainier Sunday during the daylight hours. A Puget Sound Convergence Zone may produce locally heavy snowfall Sunday evening between Stevens and Snoqualmie Passes. Pay attention to quickly changing surface snow characteristics; April avalanches involving new snow often catch those expecting a more predictable spring regime. Last year, we had<a href=""http://www.nwac.us/accidents/accident-reports/""> 2 avalanche fatalities</a> in mid-April. </p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">New snowfall will still be susceptible to strong spring solar effects and daytime warming Sunday despite the cool snow levels and mostly cloudy skies forecast. Watch for wet surface snow deeper than a few inches, natural or triggered snowballing, and small natural wet loose avalanches which usually precede larger avalanches on solar slopes.</span></p>

<p>New wind slab should build on Sunday on lee slopes mainly above treeline. Watch for signs of firmer wind transported snow or cracking snow. </p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Friday:</h2>
                <p>Friday will be the last very warm day of this hot stretch. Cooling should begin in the Olympics as a weak front and onshore flow (cool westerlies) develop in the morning and spread inland to the west slopes of the Cascades/Mt. Hood later in the day. Gradual cooling will be delayed until Friday night for the east slopes. Cloud cover should increase in the afternoon over the mountains. Upper mountain winds should increase, especially at Mt. Hood.  However, a warm Thursday night and part of Friday coupled with morning to potentially early afternoon sunshine will prolong the high avalanche danger Friday.  </p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Natural or triggered avalanches should be likely to very likely Friday and travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended.  Some of these slides may become large and potentially destructive in force.  </span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Initially small loose avalanches could still involve large amounts of wet or moist snow and lead to very large and destructive avalanches. Even smaller wet snow avalanches are heavier and more powerful than you think and can easily lead to injury or pushing a caught person into unintended terrain. For more info on wet slab avalanches please read<a href=""http://http://www.avalanche.ca/uploads/decisionmaking/DM_AvalProbEssentials_WT_V1.0.pdf""> this document</a>.  </span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Glide avalanches can release at any time as water lubricates a smooth bed surface resulting in a full depth release. Watch for glide cracks and limit exposure to potential and hard to predict <a href=""http://www.fsavalanche.org/encyclopedia/glide.htm"">glide avalanches</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Think about the terrain you are connected to and the </span>consequences of a larger<span style=""line-height: 1.6em;""> wet slab avalanche as you travel through the backcountry. </span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">The avalanche danger is expected to be relatively lower over the weekend due to cooler weather. Please see the weekend outlook below.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;""><strong>Weekend Avalanche and Mountain Weather Outlook:</strong>  An upper level low pressure system will allow a series of fronts to swing through the Pacific Northwest this weekend. The snow level should fall Friday night and settle to between 4500-5500 feet with periods of light to occasionally moderate showers with mostly cloudy skies. The front arriving on Sunday looks to be the wetter front this weekend. Alpine winds out of the SW look to the be the strongest over Mt. Hood this weekend. </span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Over the weekend wet snow avalanche concerns should eventually shift to new storm and wind slab concerns above treeline, however expect lingering effects from our very warm week.  </span>It will take time for the snowpack to transition to a more typical springtime profile. <span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">Natural wet snow avalanches may become less likely and less widespread over the weekend, but plenty of free water will keep the upper snowpack in a weakened state and maintain large amounts of heavy wet snow available for entrainment.  Melt-freeze crusts may be weak, or may not develop at lower elevations. </span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6em;"">The weekend outlook will be updated Friday evening when the warning expires. </span></p>

<p>On Saturday, snow levels should start low and rise throughout the day as precipitation intensity increases during the daylight hours. The biggest avalanche concern for Saturday will be direct-action wind and storm slab avalanches.  Rising temperatures should cause an upside down snowfall... and at lower and mid elevations a changeover to rain will load snowfall received earlier in the day. Heavy periods of snowfall will lead to storm snow instabilities. Also, increasing SW winds should scour exposed ridgelines and quickly load north through southeast aspects.   </p>

<p>New snowfall received Saturday and Saturday night will test recently buried weak layers. Warmer air should mix even into the northeast Cascades by Sunday morning.  Check the mountain weather forecast for details. </p>

                <p>A change to northwest winds, decreasing snow showers and much lower snow levels will be seen at Mt Hood Wednesday afternoon. About 6-12 inches of new snow seems likely mainly in the near and above treeline by Wednesday midday.</p>

<p>The main avalanche problems at Mt Hood Wednesday should be new wind slab and new storm slab. These new layers should be found mainly in the near and above treeline. Avoid travel on steep lee slopes with firmer wind transported snow that is a sign of wind slab. Storm slab should be limited to steep slopes in areas that receive more than an inch of snow an hour for at least several hours.</p>

<p>Have a plan in place before you get to the trailhead. Confidence is fair for this forecast.</p>

Older wind slab on more westerly aspects may still be sensitive in certain areas.

<p>This should minimally increase the avalanche danger Thursday. Shallow new storm and wind slab may develop by the end of the day near and above treeline. Loose wet avalanches seem unlikely below treeline even with rain given the consolidated state of the snowpack.  </p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">On backcountry travel safety note, watch for terrain hazards (exposed rocks, trees, streams, etc.) at lower elevations and on wind scoured aspects</span><span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">. On non-solar aspects with a slick and supportable crust, take extra caution when traversing steep slopes and be prepared to self-arrest if necessary.</span></p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Sunday:</h2>
                <p><strong>Update Sunday early morning</strong>: Conditions vary quite a bit west of the crest Sunday early morning where the Stevens Pass area has had 15 inches of snow over night but with little elsewhere west of the crest. A high avalanche danger has been issued for the Stevens Pass area near and above treeline. There may have been storm and wind slab avalanches already there overnight.</p>

<p><strong>Conditions remainder of Sunday</strong>: A wet cold front will cross the Northwest Saturday night. Snow levels will be highest on Saturday night. A good period of southwest-west flow, moderate to heavy orographic snow showers, and cooling with lowering snow levels should be seen on Sunday. New snow by the end of the day Sunday west of the crest should vary a lot from lower to higher elevations with a foot or more at higher elevations.</p>

<p>Building storm slab is likely mainly near and above treeline on Sunday. Watch for cracking and releases on steep sheltered slopes where snowfall exceeds an inch an hour for more than a few hours.</p>

<p>Building wind slab is also likely mainly near and above treeline on Sunday. Watch for firmer wind transported snow on lee slopes.</p>

<p>The freezing rain crust at Snoqualmie may <span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">act as a bed surface in that area.</span></p>

<p>The cooling should cause some good snow conditions on other slopes. Don't let powder starvation change plans to stick to safe slopes on Sunday. It is always a good plan to give new snow layers a day to stabilize before venturing to steeper slopes after a storm.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Thursday:</h2>
                <p>A weak dissipating front should move through an upper ridge and across the Northwest on Thursday. This should cause some light rain or snow in most areas west of the crest with a minor drop in snow levels. Offshore surface flow should cause cool east winds in the lower Cascade passes. A light wintry mix of precipitation seems possible at the lower Cascade passes mainly Snoqualmie.</p>

<p>This weather should have limited effects on snow conditions.</p>

<p>Mainly watch for lingering areas of firmer wind transported snow and wind slab on previous lee slopes from the back end of the storm early this week.</p>

<p>New snow amounts should be limited on Thursday and any new wind slab should be unlikely, shallow and small if any.</p>

<p>Loose wet avalanches will not be indicated due to the cloud cover and cooling. Storm slab will also not be listed due to the expected limited amounts of new snow. </p>

<p>In all areas east of the crest loose wet and and wet slab avalanches will be listed as avalanche problems on Friday. East of the crest these problems should be more likely in areas with the most recent snowfall and expected greater rainfall on Friday which is the Northeast and Central East zones. But loose wet or wet slab avalanches should be seen in all areas east of the crest.</p>

<p>Often loose wet avalanches occur just prior to wet slab avalanches. Avoid steep slopes if you are in increasing heavy rain and start to see wet snow deeper than a few inches or increasing natural pinwheels or rollerballs. The avalanche danger should continue to increase Friday night.</p>

<p>A persistent slab problem will also be forecast for the Northeast and Central East zone on Friday. There is less certainty about this problem but it should get a good test via rain and warming on Friday and if this layer is human triggered it is likely to have greater consequences due to size and propagation.</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">There is some uncertainty in this forecast. If the heaviest rain occurs Friday night then the greater avalanche danger may also occur Friday night.</span></p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Thursday:</h2>
                <p><strong>Morning update for higher avalanche danger in Cascades West Mt. Baker Zone Thursday</strong></p>

<p>Southwest flow will carry the first in a parade of mild wet fronts across the Northwest on Thursday. This will cause increasing winds and increasing moderate to heavy rain or snow by Thursday morning with rising snow levels. Snow levels west of the crest should rise to about 6000 feet in the north and 7000 feet in the south by Thursday afternoon.</p>

<p>The more widespread avalanche problem west of the crest on Thursday should be increasing loose wet snow avalanches involving snow from so far in February. The late January crust should make a good bed surface on many slopes. Small natural or triggered loose wet avalanches should be likely in many areas with some large wet loose avalanches. This problem should be most likely near and below treeline where there is more rain but may work its way into the above treeline by the end of the day due to rising snow levels.</p>

<p>Some new storm slab and wind slab should also build above treeline in the morning hours. The trend of rising temperature will help build upside down higher density snow over lower density snow above the snow level. New storm or wind slab of up to several inches seems possible above the snow level. Any surviving buried surface hoar from late January would act as a weak layer.</p>

<p>Dangerous avalanche conditions are expected on Thursday. Watch for rapidly changing snow conditions if you decide to venture into avalanche terrain.</p>

<p>Loose wet and wet slab avalanches are possible below and near treeline due to rain on snow, with the potential to entrain snowfall received earlier this week above the most recent crust.</p>

<p>Higher density snowfall will overlie lower density snow above treeline, making for unstable storm slabs especially on lee aspects in the alpine. </p>

<p>Friday will be a poor day for backcountry travel no matter how you cut it.   </p>

                <p>The upper ridge will begin to rebuild over the west US on Tuesday. At Mt Hood this should cause decreasing west winds with light showers decreasing Tuesday morning and ending Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>New wind slab from the storm on Monday maybe found mainly on steep NW to E slopes near ridges above treeline. Watch for firmer wind transported snow.</p>

<p>New storm slab seems possible where there is more than a few inches of snowfall in areas with light wind.</p>

<p>Any cooling will be limited Tuesday morning and temperatures will be on the rise again by Tuesday afternoon. More loose wet avalanches  are likely on steep mainly solar slopes.</p>

<p>As a result of the unseasonably low snowpack, especially at lower elevations, watch for terrain hazards such as open creeks, partially covered rocks and vegetation.</p>

                <p>Fair weather should be seen on Wednesday with some high clouds especially over the Olympics and north Cascades. Quite a rise in freezing levels should be seen Wednesday so that means significantly warmer temperatures.</p>

Don't underestimate the power of slow moving loose wet snow avalanches which could take you some where you don't want to go such as into gullies or other terrain traps and then sets up like concrete. <span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">These conditions should extend to some extent down into the near treeline and the upper part of the below treeline.</span></p>

While this is expected mainly on solar slopes midday watch for it on other aspects as well. Overnight cooling and surface refreezing will limit this problem on non-solar slopes and during the night and morning hours.</p>

<p>As a result of the overall low snowpack, especially below treeline, watch for terrain hazards such as open creeks, partially covered rocks and vegetation.</p>

The winds were so strong to likely have blasted the shallow surface snow to who knows where, rather than steadily building new wind slab layers.

                <p style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">Tuesday should be another warm and at least initially sunny day. Most areas do not have sufficient loose surface snow to become wet and easily available for wet snow avalanches. However, in isolated areas the best window for small wet loose avalanches on steeper solar slopes should occur in the late morning or mid-day before increasing high clouds and SW winds diminish the already small likelihood. </p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">Cornices are not listed as an expected problem, but may begin to weaken during the warmest part of the day. It's the time of year to be extra aware of the hazards cornices pose travelling along or below ridgelines. </p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">Due to the low <span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">snowpack, especially below treeline, watch for terrain hazards such as open creeks, partially covered rocks and vegetation. Many areas below treeline do not have enough </span><span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">snow (new or existing)</span><span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;""> to pose an avalanche hazard.</span></p>

                <p style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">A front that taps sub tropical moisture should cause strong southwest winds and increasing moderate to heavy rain in the Cascades on Saturday. It looks like an initial wave on the front will somewhat evenly affect the Cascades from Mt Baker to Mt Hood.</p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">The moderate to heavy rain is expected to reach above treeline at Mt Hood on Saturday. On any slopes holding old powder or less consolidated surface snow this will likely cause loose wet avalanches. Watch for wet surface snow deeper than a few inches, natural avalanches, and pinwheels or rollerballs on steep north facing or previously shaded slopes mainly above and perhaps near treeline.</p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">Below treeline rain <span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">is not expected to have as much effect since the snowpack on these slopes beforehand is so limited, consolidated and stable. </span></p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;""><span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">It seems possible that any cornices will get a bit of a test at Mt Hood Saturday.

                <p style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;""><span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">A southwest-northeast oriented front will move slowly to the International border area on Thursday with a series of waves beginning to move along the front. This should cause new snow above treeline and rain near and below treeline in the north Cascades Thursday afternoon. But the central and south Cascades should remain dry through the daylight hours on Thursday.</span></p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">So the main change to watch for will be in the northwest Cascades Thursday afternoon. In these areas above treeline watch for new wind and new storm slab to develop if there is more than several inches of new snow by the end of the daylight hours. Less new snow will mean less of an increase in new wind and storm slab avalanche danger.</p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">Further snow above treeline and rain near and below treeline should be seen in the northwest Cascades Thursday night.</p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">In all areas west of the crest Thursday watch for previous shallow wind slab on previous lee slopes. Loose wet avalanches should also remain possible especially on solar slopes.</p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">Less recent snow and ample terrain anchors should greatly limit the avalanche danger below <gs class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"" ginger_software_uiphraseguid=""0a79fa05-f8b9-4862-b1a7-da6cfdcf3b39"" id=""699b1aea-325b-4987-939b-5d1b5917193b"">treeline</gs><span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">.</span><span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;""> </span></p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">Loose wet avalanches Thursday will have the ability to start in the surface layers and entrain significant amounts of snow received earlier this week. Larger avalanches will be possible above treeline where more recent snowfall has been received.  <span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">Avoid steeper slopes if you are sinking in more than a few inches, and be aware the even small loose wet avalanches are powerful and can push you into unintended terrain features.  </span></p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">Fresh cornices along ridgelines have likely been weakened and should become susceptible to failure Thursday with warming and potential sunshine. Make sure to give them a wide berth, and be aware of corniced slopes above you. </p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">Increasing winds and increasing snow mainly above and near treeline at Mt Hood may begin to build new wind and storm slab Friday afternoon. These new layers should still be shallow by the end of the afternoon. The danger will be greater if the snowfall begins sooner or is heavier than expected by the end of the afternoon.</p>

                <p>Sunny warmer weather will continue on Saturday. This should keep the focus on likely loose wet avalanches and possible cornice failures mainly during the midday and afternoon hours.</p>

<p>Morning crusts and midday to afternoon wet snow should be common on Saturday. There is some uncertainty to the danger levels on Saturday since the snowpack in transition and  there was already some avalanches and consolidation late in the week but it will be warm over the weekend. It will be beautiful to be in the Olympics and Cascades Saturday but remember to make careful snowpack evaluations and cautious route finding decisions especially above treeline.</p>

<p>Wind slab will not be listed as an avalanche problem but watch for signs of lingering firmer wind transported snow if you visit any high, cool, lee slopes.</p>

<p>There was a widespread weak layer of small reactive faceted crystals found at Washington Pass a week ago about 5-8 inches below the surface. Skiers have not reported any triggered storm or wind slab avalanches due to this layer and it is unknown if the layer might still be reactive. It should be a good idea to check for this layer around Washington Pass in quick snow pits on cool lee slopes where it might still be preserved.</p>

<p>Remember that this forecast applies to elevations up to the Cascade crest and not to the high parts of the volcanoes where conditions at this time of year are often more dangerous.</p>

<p>The work of the 3 NWAC forecasters is transitioning to other essential parts of the program before the NWAC closes for the summer. <a href=""http://rei.com/event/66184/session/113656"">Going Deep session #6</a> is next Thursday and the topic is Making the Transition From Winter to Spring, when daily NWAC forecasts are not available.

                <p><span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">The low pressure system will shift east of the Cascade crest on Saturday. Showers mainly west of the crest should be mostly light and less extensive on Saturday. There should be little if any additional snowfall on Saturday.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">Storm snow amounts are likely to vary a lot by Saturday morning from perhaps around 5 inches at Hurricane, to 5-10 inches west of the crest, but with about 1.5 feet or more at Mt Baker, around 1 foot at Mt Hood, and only light amounts at higher elevations east of the crest.</span></p>

<p>Avalanche problems Saturday will in turn vary a lot depending storm snow amounts. Don't underestimate the effects of the increasing strong April sun which could make avalanches touchy on Saturday. <span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">Areas with moderate amounts of new snow will give poorer skiing and areas with heavier snow are likely to be dangerous such as near and above treeline at Mt Baker. A bed surface may be provided by crusts from warm weather in mid-April.</span></p>

<p>Loose wet avalanches should become touchy and easily triggered on solar slopes in areas of heavier snowfall Saturday mid-morning through the afternoon. This is very likely on solar slopes but possible on all slopes in areas of heavier snowfall. Watch for wet surface snow that gets deeper than a few inches, pinwheels or initial small natural avalanches from rocks or cliffs that are signs to shift to lower angle slopes.</p>

<p>Firmer wind transported snow and wind slab will be most likely to linger on lee slopes. Storm slab should be shorter lived on Saturday. Both are also most likely in areas of heavier snowfall at higher elevations.</p>

<p>If you decide to venture into the back country on Saturday it should be best to find an area of lighter or no storm snowfall such as east of the crest.</p>

<p>Cornices won't be listed as an avalanche problem but avoid slopes below cornices and areas on ridge where it may be difficult to know if a cornice is present.</p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">Remember that this forecast applies to elevations up to the Cascade crest and not to the high parts of the volcanoes where conditions at this time of year are often more dangerous.</p>

The below treeline elevation band generally does not have enough snow to produce avalanches.</p>, '\n\n', <p>We still have many gaps in our observation network as it's early season, so make your own observations and use them in co-junction to our regional avalanche forecast. Thanks for reading the first NWAC avalanche forecast for 2015-16 season, stay safe and have fun! </p>, '\n\n            ', <div class=""forecast-detailed"">
                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Sunday:</h2>
                <p>The strong front that is bringing heavy snow and a warming trend to the Olympics and Washington Cascades on Saturday night and Sunday will bring much less new snow to Mt Hood. At Mt Hood only a few inches of new snow is expected. Winds may build some new small wind slab on lee north to east slopes. New small shallow storm slab is possible in calmer areas.</p>

<p>But  stronger system should begin to move into the Olympics and Cascades Sunday night. But be prepared to curtail your plans later Sunday if conditions deteriorate sooner than expected.</p>

<p>Early season hazards exist for much of the below treeline band throughout the Northwest, so ski and ride with caution.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Monday:</h2>
                <p>A warm front on Sunday night will be rapidly followed by another warm front on Monday. Strong southwest to west winds should be seen in the alpine with moderate to heavy rain or snow mainly Sunday night and  again by Monday midday with further warming. Snowfall so far in December by Monday morning along the west slopes should range from 1-4 feet which has been fairly evenly distributed but with the most at Mt Baker.</p>

<p>More new potentially large wind and storm slab will continue to be the focus on Monday along the entire west slopes. Back country travel in the near or above treeline is not recommended on Monday. Visibility will probably be poor on Monday with slab layers increasing making it difficult to avoid avalanche terrain.</p>

<p>Note that the west slopes do not have a uniform snowpack! The weather in late November is expected to have caused a persistent slab at Stevens and Snoqualmie Passes. Persistent slab is especially dangerous because it may be harder to trigger and propagate rapidly causing larger faster moving avalanches.</p>

<p>With little snow below treeline, wet loose snow avalanches will not be in the forecast. But change your plans if you find wet snow deeper than a few inches or see signs of wet loose activity such as pin wheels or natural wet loose avalanches.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Saturday:</h2>
                <p>Snow will begin by mid-morning and increase in intensity throughout the day. In addition, there should be a gradual warming trend as snow levels peak between around 4000 feet in the late afternoon. Combined with increasing southerly transport winds in the afternoon, there will be an increasing avalanche risk through the daylight hours. </p>

<p>Storm slabs should become more sensitive and likely to trigger in the afternoon. Wind slabs should also become easier to trigger as they build on NW through E lee slopes throughout the day. The above treeline winds are forecast to be quite strong Saturday afternoon, so don't underestimate the rapid loading occurring at higher elevations.  </p>

<p>Expect deteriorating snow stability as the day progresses and the storm really takes hold. Travel conservatively by staying off steeper slopes and avoiding wind loaded terrain, especially later in the day,</p>

<p>Be aware of early season hazards below treeline. The heavy rains from last week have left many creeks open at lower elevations. </p>

<p>Moderate to heavy precipitation is expected to continue through Saturday night and much of Sunday, so look for increasing avalanche danger later in the weekend. </p>

                <p>A frontal system overnight should enhance and maintain strong winds and heavy precipitation rates at relatively high freezing levels, before changing to showers with cooling Friday.   </p>

<p>Avalanche problems Friday should be associated with new wind slab layers, especially near and above treeline and to a lesser extent possible storm slab layer. New and recent snow will be deposited on lee NW-SE aspects. Most avalanches should be confined to the new storm snow since Thursday, but a few may step down to older storm layers or crusts in isolated locations.  </p>

<p>In areas near and below treeline, the warming and rain Thursday on Mt Hood, likely to near or above about 6500 feet, likely caused widespread natural avalanches on many steep slopes. This should limit the danger by Friday, especially as significant cooling begins to form new surface crust layers below the elevation that experienced rain or wet, heavy snow. This should limit any avalanches to mainly shallow new snow below treeline.  </p>

<p>However, near and above treeline, increasing snowfall and winds are expected overnight Thursday and early Friday.

                <p>The next strong cool cold front will cross the Northwest Saturday night and Sunday morning. This will renew moderate to heavy snow in the Olympics and Cascades Saturday night and Sunday morning with a minor warming trend but the snow level will stay below the passes. It looks like the heaviest snow will shift to Oregon Sunday.</p>

<p>Rapid loading will cause new storm and wind slab will build Saturday night and Sunday. It looks like the most snowfall will be on the volcanoes including Mt Hood where 1-2 feet should be seen by later Sunday so the avalanche danger should be greatest on the volcanoes. This means that some large natural or triggered storm and wind slab should be seen in some areas during the main part of the storm Sunday morning at Mt Hood. But these conditions could easily last all day Sunday.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Monday:</h2>
                <p>A strong low pressure system will move west to east across Washington on Monday. There should be a big difference in the weather and avalanche conditions between the north and south Cascades with the strongest winds and heaviest snowfall in the south Cascades. Right now it looks like the main effects of the low may reach as far north as the central Cascades. But a different track of the low could bring much different than expected weather and avalanche conditions on Monday so the forecast is somewhat uncertain.</p>

<p>Light to moderate winds and snow are expected in the north Cascades on Monday. Stronger shifting winds, moderate to heavy snow and rapid loading are expected in the central to south Cascades. New storm slab and wind slab potential will be greatest in the central to south Cascades. Back country travel is not recommended above treeline in the central and south Cascades on Monday. Dangerous avalanche conditions are expected in the other areas along the east slopes.</p>

                <p>Another Pacific frontal system, in the long series of recent storms, is moving into the Mt Hood area Tuesday evening. This next system will cause renewed light to moderate snow and light to moderate westerly winds Tuesday night. This should begin to build new areas of wind slab on lee slopes below ridges and create some isolated storm slabs.

<p>Dangerous avalanche conditions should persist Wednesday in all elevations bands and especially in the near and above treeline zones. </p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Tuesday:</h2>
                <p>A couple more weak short waves and weak bands of precipitation should move out of a large weak trough and over the Northwest on Tuesday. This will cause more periods of mostly light snow in the Olympics and Cascades on Tuesday. Several inches or more of snowfall is possible on the volcanoes. Offshore surface flow should limit snowfall in the Cascade Passes. A slight warming trend should be seen on Tuesday.</p>

<p>New snowfall may further load possible buried surface hoar and near surface faceted snow from around New Years. This new snow may continue to be somewhat upside down with denser snow near the surface which contributes to instability. The greatest accumulations should be from about Snoqualmie to Mt Rainier and the greatest avalanche danger will be indicated in that area.</p>

<p>Wind slab will need to watched for on a variety of aspects. Old wind slab may still be found on the more usual north to southeast slopes.  Wind slab from over the weekend is mostly likely on west aspects. New wind slab may be starting to form in some areas again on Monday on the more usual north to southeast aspects. But new wind slab should be less of an issue in the North Cascades where winds and snowfall continue to be less. </p>

<p>Mostly older wind slab will still need to be watched for on a variety of aspects. Wind slab from over the weekend is most likely on west aspects. Look for signs of firmer wind transported snow that can indicate wind slab layers.</p>

<p>Some sun or solar effects and slightly warmer temperatures should also be seen on Wednesday. Loose wet avalanches seem like a possible bet as well on steep solar slopes. Watch for wet snow deeper than a few inches and initial natural small loose wet releases on solar slopes that usually precede loose wet avalanches.</p>

                <p>Light winds, some sun breaks and moderate temperatures should allow for a further slow decrease in the danger Friday. In general, any recently formed shallow wind slabs overlying recently buried crusts should be less sensitive to skier triggering. In specific areas, small human-triggered slab avalanches could still be possible. Before committing to a slope, think about the consequences of the terrain if even a small avalanche occurred. Watch for wet snow conditions during sun breaks on solar aspects.</p>

                <p>Sunny warmer weather should be seen on Sunday. It may be significantly warmer at higher elevations and west of the crest.</p>

<p>The main problem on Sunday should be loose wet avalanches. It is a bit hard to say how extensive the loose wet avalanches will be so pay close attention to snow conditions if you venture out on Sunday. Possible loose wet avalanches should be mainly confined to steep southeast to southwest aspects during the late morning to early afternoon hours. Watch for surface wet snow deeper than a few inches, initial roller balls and initial small natural  or triggered loose wet avalanches.</p>

<p>We have lowered the likelihood of triggering an older wind slab avalanche. But it will still be wise to watch for firmer wind transported snow on specific terrain features. The most likely locations are steep slopes below ridges or cross loaded ribs mainly near or above treeline.</p>

<p>Some powder may still found out there on sheltered north slopes. Surface crusts will also abound to bring added enjoyment to your outing.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Tuesday:</h2>
                <p><strong>Morning update:</strong> In the Cascades southwest zone that includes Crystal Mt and Paradise, the avalanche danger has been raised to Considerable for all elevation bands as human and natural triggered avalanches become more likely in the afternoon and early evening. Loose wet avalanches have been added for the below treeline band where rain and warmer temperatures are likely. Conservative decision making for the deteriorating conditions will be essential to stay safe today. Avalanche conditions are expected to deteriorate further in the evening.  </p>

<p><strong>Previous discussion: </strong></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">An incoming frontal system on Tuesday should largely stall along the coast during the day with periods of rain and snow for the Cascades. More moderate precipitation and stronger transport winds should hold off until Tuesday evening and night. Mild snow levels initially seen away from the Passes should gradually lower as the precipitation rates increase in the late afternoon and evening. East winds through the Cascade Passes should keep snow levels below pass level Tuesday.    </span></p>

<p>Shallow storm and wind slab avalanches are possible by Tuesday afternoon as snowfall rates and transport winds increase later in the day. <span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">Northwest through East aspects should continue to see additional light loading near and above treeline Tuesday, but look for wind slab on a variety of aspects especially near the Passes. Watch</span> for signs of firmer wind transported snow that can indicate wind slab layers near and below ridges. If storm conditions develop faster than expected, change your travel plans accordingly for the increased hazard. </p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">Shallow loose wet avalanches are possible Tuesday mainly below treeline on steeper slopes for areas away from the Passes that see warming or light rainfall initially, however loose wet avalanches will not be listed as a primary problem Tuesday.   </span></p>

Wind slabs may have grown very large over the past few days... and although fairly unlikely to naturally release or to be responsive to human triggering, would lead to a large and deadly slide.  </span></p>

<p>Storm slabs may still be sensitive to human triggering on Thursday, so choose more moderate slopes if you find lingering storm snow instabilities. </p>

<p>Loose wet avalanches will become likely due to light rain and rising freezing levels. Loose wet avalanches should be small and confined to steeper slopes near and below treeline. Be especially wary near terrain traps, where even a small avalanche could have unintended consequences. </p>

<p>A variety of avalanche problems on Thursday will present dangerous conditions in all elevation bands at Mt. Hood. If you venture out Thursday, use conservative decision making and terrain selection relative to the avalanche problem. </p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Friday:</h2>
                <p>In the northeast and centraleast Cascades, moderate snowfall Thursday night through Friday morning and a slow warming trend should gradually stress and load buried weak layers, potentially resulting in large and destructive avalanches. A natural avalanche cycle may occur Thursday night through Friday morning. The danger from storm and wind slab avalanches will begin high Friday morning, but should decrease as showers taper down Friday afternoon and temperatures cool in the near and above treeline zones.  </p>

<p>Travel in backcountry terrain is not recommended Friday due to these conditions. </p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">Natural wet loose avalanches are possible predominately below treeline Friday and mainly on steeper slopes where temperatures stay or rise above freezing. Be especially wary near terrain traps, where even a small avalanche could have unintended consequences. Loose wet avalanches may entrain a considerable amount of storm snow, even at low elevations. </span></p>

<p>The danger should be lower in the southeast Cascades, where less recent snowfall was received. </p>

The main concern are areas of shallow wind slabs on lee slopes near ridges. Any previously wet or moist surface snow should have formed a strengthening crust by Sunday, locally decreasing danger.</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">New, wind slab</span><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;""> on lee easterly slopes near and above treeline, but should be isolated to specific terrain features. </span></p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Tuesday:</h2>
                <p>One more day of light winds and cool temperatures should be seen at Mt Hood on Tuesday.</p>

<p>This weather should bring a further gradually decreasing avalanche danger.</p>

<p>The greatest avalanche problem should be wind slab on lee slopes near and above treeline mainly N-SE facing slopes. Watch for signs of cracking or firmer wind transported snow.</p>

<p>Also watch for lingering storm slab in areas that had rapidly accumulating snowfall.</p>

<p>Although this won't be listed as a problem watch for triggered loose dry avalanches if you venture onto very steep slopes.</p>

<p>Loose wet avalanches also won't be listed as a problem but if solar effects or sun are significant watch for wet snow deeper than a few inches and pinwheels or small natural loose wet avalanches that usually precede larger loose wet avalanches on solar slopes.</p>

<p>Avoid ridges where cornices may be present and slopes below cornices. Cornices can always be sensitive to human triggers.</p>

                <p>The next weather system will move strongly to the Olympics and north Cascades Friday late morning and spread to the rest of the Cascades by Friday evening with fairly high snow levels.</p>

<p>A fairly broad brush will be applied to the avalanche forecast for Friday. Expect a mixed bag of ugly snow conditions and a high avalanche danger in the near and above treeline elevation bands at Mt Hood.</p>

<p>Wet snow and rain or warm temperatures should further build or activate wind and storm slab mainly in the above tree line band.</p>

<p>Recent snow will be available for activation by warm temperatures for potentially large loose wet avalanches at Mt Hood. Watch for surface wet snow deeper than a few inches and pinwheels or small natural loose wet avalanches that usually precede large loose wet avalanches.</p>

<p>But new snow and cooler temperatures should be seen by Saturday.</p>

                <p>Strong southwest winds aloft will accompany a cold front will cross the Northwest on Friday evening. West winds will follow with orographic snow showers and a good cooling trend on Saturday morning.</p>

<p>The cooling trend may help bond new snow to old snow surfaces where the snow starts at above freezing temperatures. With a little luck many areas along the west slopes will have about 5-10 inches of new snow by the time snow showers taper off on Saturday.</p>

<p>The main avalanche problem should be new wind slab on lee slopes in the near and above treeline. Watch for signs of snowpack cracking and firmer wind transported snow on lee slopes.</p>

<p>A secondary avalanche problem should be new storm slab in areas with less wind if there is rapid loading. The cooling trend may help limit this avalanche problem.</p>

Stevens, Crystal and Baker patrols saw less results despite significant wind transport.  In general the new snow came in right side up and bonded well to the old snow surface. The exception was the slope involved in the Crystal accident. Surface hoar formed early last week was buried by lower density snow and then wind loaded.

Two skiers descending East Peak crossed from a windward slope to a lee slope above Ted's Buttress a few hundred feet below the peak (5900 ft). One triggered a wind slab on a shallow portion of the slab (40 cm) that broke well upslope of his position. Both were caught, at least partially buried by the slide and sustained injuries. One was able to self-extricate and then eventually freed his partner after considerable digging. Initial estimates are the slab averaged 40-50 cm, max 130 cm in depth, and about 100 m in width. The slope in question would have been loaded by W-SW winds. A fracture line profile performed by Crystal Mt pro-patroller Peter Dale on Sunday identified the slab released on buried surface hoar from early last week on top of the 1/28 rain crust. The slide ran over 500 ft, with the skiers carried about less than 200 vertical feet. </p>, '\n\n', <p style=""margin: 0px 0px 22px; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif; font-size: 16.2px; line-height: 24.948px;""><img alt="""" src=""http://media.nwac.us.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/2016/02/06/overview-of-teds-buttress-and-east-peak.jpg"" style=""width: 350px; height: 622px;""/></p>, '\n\n', <p style=""margin: 0px 0px 22px; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif; font-size: 16.2px; line-height: 24.948px;""> </p>, '\n\n            ', <div class=""forecast-detailed"">
                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Monday:</h2>
                <p>A warm and sunny day with lighter alpine winds should be seen on Monday. As freezing levels push above 12,000 feet, the avalanche danger will focus on loose wet avalanches. Steeper solar slopes near and above treeline should be the most likely places for natural or skier triggered loose wet avalanches. Solar slopes involve more than just due south aspects as we head further into February.  </p>

<p>The hazard should be locally lower below treeline in the Cascade Passes in areas affected by cool easterly flow and in areas that form a stout crust Sunday night. </p>

<p>Be aware of loose wet avalanche potential above terrain traps (like above cliffs or near gullies), where even small wet avalanches can become powerful and have unintended consequences.  </p>

<p>If pushing higher on the Cascade volcanoes Monday, the loose wet potential extends well above the top NWAC elevation band with larger avalanches possible.  </p>

<p>Rainfall will renew the loose wet potential on all aspects of steeper slopes. New snowfall should bond well to a moist snow surface in most locations, but wind-driven snow may build unstable wind slab on lee aspects of higher terrain by late Friday afternoon. </p>

<p>Glide avalanches occur when a smooth bed surface (ex.rock face) becomes lubricated by water and the wet slab above releases. They are not tied to specific air temperature or rainfall trends other than they occur during or after prolonged mild conditions, similar to what we have experienced over the last several days. Be aware that even with dropping snow levels Friday, powerful glide avalanches are possible in the right terrain features until we have an extended period of cold weather.   </p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Sunday:</h2>
                <p>Increasing moderate to heavy rain and snow is expected with a warming trend Saturday night through Sunday. With the snow level expected to rise to near 8000 feet by early Sunday, a significant increase in avalanche danger is expected overnight with natural avalanches becoming likely. If a natural avalanche cycle occurs overnight, this should locally lower the danger during the day Sunday, at least in those areas that experienced avalanches. The main question is about the rate and timing of warming. If the warming is not as great as expected or delayed, a very heightened avalanche danger should persist into Sunday.</p>

<p>On slopes that have not released due to warming and additional load, natural or triggered avalanches should be increasingly likely Sunday.  </p>

<p>Strong W-SW winds will transport new snow onto lee slopes near and above treeline where wind-driven snow may build unstable wind slab on lee aspects. </p>

<p>Wet loose avalanches will be a concern on steeper slopes at lower elevations.</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">Avoid cornices along ridges and slopes below cornices since cornices may still be weaker due to the warm weather.</span></p>

                <p>A weak cold front will cause rain or snow to shift from north to south over the Olympics and Cascades tonight to Tuesday morning with a slight drop in snow levels. A couple or a few inches of snow should be seen in the above treeline at Mt Hood with some more rain in the near and below tree line.</p>

<p>Another weak warm front should lift south to north over the Northwest Tuesday afternoon and night and cause light rain or snow with another slight rise in snow levels.</p>

<p>A mixed bag of conditions seems possible on Tuesday with shallow winter like snow conditions possible in the above treeline and wet snow persisting in the near and below treeline.</p>

<p>Watch for new shallow firmer wind transported snow above tree line mainly on lee N to SE slopes near ridges. You will need to be able to assess this problem for yourself if you travel above treeline on Tuesday.</p>

<p>You should continue to watch for loose wet avalanche conditions in the near and below treeline on Tuesday. Watch for wet surface snow deeper than a few inches that usually precede loose wet avalanches or other triggered or natural loose wet avalanches.

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Wednesday:</h2>
                <p>An occluded front should rotate out of a low pressure system over the Northwest coastal waters late Wednesday. This should cause light rain or snow to spread to the Olympics and Cascades Wednesday afternoon. Further increasing rain or snow should be seen Wednesday evening especially on the volcanoes. Temperatures will remain mild on Wednesday.</p>

<p>A mixed bag of conditions should continue on Wednesday with winter like snow conditions possible in the above treeline and wet snow persisting near and below treeline.</p>

<p>This forecast will be conservative and list wind slab as possible in the above tree line on Wednesday. Watch for new firmer wind transported snow mainly on lee N to SE slopes near ridges. You will need to be able to assess this problem for yourself if you travel above treeline.</p>

<p>You should continue to watch for loose wet avalanche conditions in the near and below treeline on Wednesday. Watch for wet surface snow deeper than a few inches that usually precede loose wet avalanches or other triggered or natural loose wet avalanches. Steep slopes near and below treeline are probably still best avoided.</p>

<p>Wet slab avalanches won't be listed as a problem but quickly change your plans if you see evidence of wet slab avalanches. You can check for significant liquid water in layers in snow pits.</p>

<p>Glide avalanches also won't be listed as a problem but avoid areas below steep rocks still holding snow since these slopes can release at unpredictable times.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Thursday:</h2>
                <p>An occluded front pushing through Wednesday night should be followed by light showers on Thursday morning and a cooling trend. A surface low tracking inland near the Oregon/Washington border mid-day Thursday should provide a burst of moderate snowfall in the afternoon and evening hours for the southern Washington Cascades, followed by strong W-SW winds. Lighter snowfall is expected further areas further north during the daylight hours. </p>

<p>New wind slab should build on lee slopes near and above treeline Thursday afternoon and evening. Watch for new firmer wind transported snow mainly on lee N to SE slopes near ridges. </p>

<p>Storm snow with a cooling trend Wednesday night and Thursday should generally bond well to surface snow comprising of wet grains or various crust layers. Heavier precipitation rates Thursday afternoon and evening should increase the storm slab likelihood especially for the southern Washington Cascades.  </p>

<p>Despite the cooling trend, loose wet avalanches will remain possible below treeline Thursday especially on steeper slopes. Watch for wet surface snow deeper than a few inches that usually precede loose wet avalanches or other triggered or natural loose wet avalanches. </p>

<p>Glide avalanches also won't be listed as a problem but avoid areas below steep rocks still holding snow since these slopes can release at unpredictable times. Look for glide cracks in steep terrain to offer clues of the slab undergoing downhill creep. </p>

<p>Despite the cooling trend, loose wet avalanches will remain possible below treeline Friday especially on steeper southerly facing slopes. Watch for wet surface snow deeper than a few inches that usually precede loose wet avalanches or other triggered or natural loose wet avalanches. </p>

<p>Recent E-SE winds have redistributed recent snowfall to non-traditional westerly aspects forming generally shallow but touchy windslab primarily in the near and above treeline elevation bands, but may still be possible below treeline depending on local loading patterns.  </p>

<p>Watch for wind transported snow on a variety of aspects Wednesday: Don't let the combination of Moderate avalanche danger with non-traditional lee aspects/cross-loaded slopes catch you by surprise!  </p>

<p>Loose wet avalanches may be the primary problem in your area depending on the amount of sunshine Wednesday. Freezing levels will rise on Wednesday and combined with sunshine should activate loose wet avalanches on steeper solar slopes. Watch for pinwheeling and rollerballs as precursors to more significant loose wet activity and especially be wary of loose wet avalanches around terrain traps. </p>

<p>New storm slab should also build through the day in areas that rapidly accumulate snow. This avalanche problem may work its way down into the upper treeline by the end of the day. Rapid snow accumulation is generally more than an inch or 2 an hour for several or more hours.</p>

<p>Dangerous avalanche conditions are expected by Sunday afternoon especially in the near and above tree line. Careful snow evaluation and conservative decision-making should be essential on Sunday.</p>

                <p>Showers and at times blustery west winds Sunday night should taper down Monday morning. High clouds from an approaching warm front will spread over Mt. Hood in the afternoon. There should be a slow warming trend Monday. </p>

<p>New wind slab should be sensitive on lee aspects Monday, with significant amounts of new snow transported Sunday and Sunday night. Play it conservative on Monday and give new wind slabs time to settle by avoiding freshly loaded slopes. Wind slab may extend into the below treeline zone as strong winds Sunday and Sunday night transported snow further downslope than usual. Watch for firmer wind transported snow and surface snow cracking as you travel throughout the terrain.</p>

<p>The storm system came in right side up with a cooling trend, so storm slabs will be a lower concern and possible in non-wind affected terrain.</p>

<p>Storm slab instabilities should develop during intense precipitation periods and due to the overall warming trend Monday night. A natural avalanche cycle will likely occur Monday night with the danger decreasing during the day as precipitation tapers down and rising snow levels plateau. </p>

<p>New wind slab should develop mainly above treeline on N through SE slopes. Loose wet avalanches will become very likely on steeper slopes in areas that see a switch to rain. Avalanches that begin in the new snow may become larger as they entrain or step down to snowfall received Sunday and Sunday night. </p>

<p>Very dangerous avalanche conditions are expected to develop late Monday night with the danger decreasing during the day on Tuesday. Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended Tuesday especially above treeline. </p>

<p>Wind slab will continue to build Tuesday night on lee slopes with moderate to strong southwest to west transport winds. Wind slab will be dense and pocketed due to the strength of the winds and also more likely to be found further downslope than usual. </p>

<p>Loose wet avalanches will become more likely on steeper slopes in the afternoon as snow levels begin to rise once again. Avalanches that begin in the new snow may become larger lower down the path as they entrain moist or wet snow.  </p>

<p>With several avalanche problems to deal with Wednesday, conservative terrain selection will be essential to stay safe because human triggered avalanches are still likely. Choose moderately angled terrain and avoid wind loaded slopes, saving those steeper lines for another day.</p>

<p><em>Non-avalanche hazard: Despite our seasonally healthy snowpack, many creeks are open and difficult to cross due to the periodic warm temperatures and rain events. </em> </p>

                <p>Light to moderate rain Saturday night will transition to showers Sunday morning with a slow cooling trend during the day. Showers may occasionally be intense on Sunday forming unstable storm layers.   </p>

                <p>A weakening front should move over a flat ridge and over the Northwest Tuesday afternoon and night. Snow from this front should mainly reach the <span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">Olympics, the southwest Cascades and Mt Hood by the end of the daylight hours on Tuesday.</span></p>

<p>Older or previous wind slab may also still be present near and above treeline along the east slopes. Watch for firmer wind transported snow.</p>

<p>Loose wet avalanche conditions may still be possible mainly on solar slopes below tree line. Watch for wet snow deeper than a few inches, pinwheels and natural loose wet avalanches.</p>

<p>The persistent slab avalanche problem will only be listed in the northeast zone, most likely found on non-solar aspects in the above and near treeline band and stretching into the upper portion of the below treeline band.  This interface is likely getting harder for a human to trigger but if triggered is capable of producing large avalanches. Be aware that at depths approaching the 1 m mark, the extended column test becomes a less reliable indicator of propagation across a column. You can attempt deeper column tests like the propagation saw test or deep tap test but layer identification and terrain selection are your best friends for managing the persistent slab danger.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Wednesday:</h2>
                <p>A weakening front should move over the Northwest Tuesday afternoon and night. This may cause some light amounts of snow at higher elevations along the east slopes but probably not as much as earlier expected.</p>

<p>The bigger story is the incoming atmospheric river on Wednesday. A warm front should south to north over the Olympics and Cascades Wednesday morning to afternoon. This should bring stormy wet weather with rising snow levels initially to Mt Hood Wednesday morning and to the Olympics and Washington Cascades Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>Little change may be seen by Wednesday morning along the Cascade east slopes. But by Wednesday afternoon watch for increasing alpine winds and increasing moderate rain or snow and rising snow levels.</p>

<p>Mainly in the above treeline new wind slab of increasing density due to warming is likely to form on lee slopes. Watch for firmer wind transported snow as the storm develops Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>Also mainly in the above treeline new storm slab of increasing density is also likely due to warming. Watch for snowfall that begins to <span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">accumulate Wednesday afternoon at more than an inch an hour.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">The persistent slab avalanche problem will only be listed in the northeast zone and is most likely to be found on non-solar aspects in the above and near treeline band and stretching into the upper portion of the below treeline band.  This interface is likely getting harder for a human to trigger but if triggered is capable of producing large avalanches. Be aware that at depths approaching the 1 m mark the extended column test becomes a less reliable indicator of propagation across a column. Deeper tests like the propagation saw test or deep tap test may help but layer identification and terrain selection are your best friends for managing a persistent slab danger.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">The rain where heavy enough mainly in the central east and southeast zones by Wednesday afternoon may activate previous layers and cause releases of previous wind slab layers or wet slab avalanches mainly in the near and below treeline. Rain in the same areas is also </span><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">likely to create loose wet avalanche conditions. Watch for pinwheels and natural loose wet avalanches</span></p>

Baker area Thursday where another foot of snow likely fell . </p>, '\n\n', <p>There remains a significant amount of water in the snowpack. <span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">The mid and lower snow pack along the west slopes should generally be a stable mix of crusts and layers of moist and rounded snow crystals.</span></p>, '\n\n', <p><strong>Recent Observations</strong></p>, '\n\n', <p>Stevens Pass and Alpental Pro Patrol reported an extensive natural cycle Wednesday night.

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Saturday:</h2>
                <p>We just can't shake the Considerable rating near and above treeline in this storm pattern despite a favorable cooling trend Saturday and only light to moderate new loading expected. Lingering wind slab formed earlier in the week shouldn't be much of an issue, but once again persistent SE to SW transport winds will build new wind slab on lee slopes Friday night and Saturday. Watch for firmer wind transported snow and be aware of local loading patterns in your terrain. Shallow storm slabs may build late Friday night through Saturday morning.   </p>

<p>Cornices should be less sensitive on Saturday, but they are large so continue to give them a wide berth when travelling along ridgelines since they can break further back then expected. </p>

<p>The loose wet potential should be minimized by the cooling trend and cloudy skies. If the sun does break out Saturday, mid-March sunshine will rapidly increase the likelihood of loose wet avalanches on steeper solar aspects.  </p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">Powerful glide avalanches remain possible in isolated </span>terrain<span style=""line-height: 20.8px;""> features such as on steep slopes with smooth bed surfaces and especially where the slabs are unsupported from below.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">A cool yet powerful storm system on Sunday may cause high avalanche danger for the southern Cascades by late Sunday afternoon. However, the storm track is uncertain and the avalanche danger will be reassessed with Saturday's forecast issuance. </span></p>

<p>The main avalanche problem along the east slopes on Sunday should be increasing strong winds and increasing snow transporting recent or new snow and building new wind slab on lee slopes.

                <p>Up to about 10-20 inches of new snow seems likely at Mt Hood by Monday morning!</p>

<p>West winds aloft and a cool slightly unstable air mass should follow the front across the Northwest on Monday. This should cause orographic snow showers and up to another 10-15 inches of new snow seems likely at Mt Hood by the end of the day.</p>

<p>This is a lot of new snow.</p>

<p>New wind and storm slab seem likely to be the main avalanche problems at Mt Hood on Monday.</p>

<p>New wind slab may be deep and is mostly likely to be found on northwest to southeast slopes. Firmer wind transported snow and snowpack cracking can be good signs of wind slab.</p>

<p>New deep storm slab is likely in areas where new snow rapidly accumulates for more than several hours. This is likely along most of the west slopes Sunday night and Monday!</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">Cloudy cool conditions on Monday may limit the development of loose wet snow but the sun is gaining power so watch for the development of loose wet snow on solar slopes.</span></p>

<p>Conditions are a bit hard to predict following the low pressure system and front on Monday. The avalanche danger may decrease a little on Monday due to a little less wind, some stabilizing of new snow and fairly cool temperatures. This forecast will take a conservative approach to the danger levels and the avalanche forecasts will get refined after new information becomes available on Monday.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Thursday:</h2>
                <p>Sunshine and moderating temperatures should be the story on Thursday. However, cool easterly winds at the mid-mountain level should locally keep rising freezing levels in check on Mt. Hood.</p>

<p>Still, mid-March sunshine will affect solar slopes by increasing the likelihood of loose wet avalanches on steeper solar aspects by quickly breaking down sun or melt-freeze crusts. While most loose wet avalanches should be small, they will have the ability to entrain recent moist snow in specific terrain. Recently formed cornices have grown large and should become more sensitive with warming and sunshine. You can mitigate the loose wet and cornice risk by being aware of the terrain your connected with and by recognizing the rapidly increasing hazard in locations that warm quickly.</p>

<p>Northwest winds on Wednesday likely continued to build wind slab on lee aspects in the upper elevations of the above treeline band. Wind slab will mostly likely be found on N-SE facing slopes. Firm wind transported snow and snowpack cracking can be good signs of wind slab instabilities. Treat wind-loaded slopes in higher terrain with caution Thursday.</p>

<p>Stronger mid-March sun should make loose wet avalanches possible on steeper solar aspects on Friday after quickly breaking down sun or melt-freeze crusts. Loose wet avalanches may start small but could have the ability to entrain recent moist snow in specific terrain. Watch for <span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">rapidly increasing hazard in locations that warm quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">Northwest winds on Wednesday likely continued to build wind slab on lee aspects in the upper elevations of the above treeline band. This wind slab will mostly likely be found on N-SE facing slopes.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">But east winds Thursday and Friday will also possibly build new wind slab on west aspects </span><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">in places along the crest</span><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">So recent and new wind slab will be indicated on most aspects in the above and near treeline on Friday. Wind slab may also be locally possible in the below treeline on west slopes in areas that have east winds on Friday. Firm wind transported snow and snowpack cracking can be good signs of wind slab layers.</span></p>

<p>Recently formed cornices have grown large and can become sensitive when it is warm and sunny. Avoid areas on ridges or summits where there may be a cornice and avoid slopes below cornices in the spring.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Thursday:</h2>
                <p style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">Cool NW flow should deliver a taste of winter in late March with light to moderate orographic snow showers at Mt. Hood Thursday. From late Wednesday night through Thursday, new snow should layer right side up as temperatures cool behind the cold front Wednesday night. Deep post-frontal moisture should prevent widespread solar affects, but some daytime warming is likely below treeline at lower elevations Thursday afternoon despite the seasonally cool air mass overhead. </p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">Persistent and strong westerly winds will primarily load lee slopes near and above treeline, but look for wind affect well into the below treeline band on Mt. Hood. Wind slab will be the primarily hazard on Thursday. By avoiding obviously wind loaded slopes, you can enjoy some fine late season conditions. <span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">Firm wind transported snow and snowpack cracking can be good signs of wind slab layers.</span></p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.8px;""><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">Loose dry avalanches should be small but likely on steeper non-solar slopes in non-wind affected terrain. Be aware of terrain traps where even a small loose avalanche could have unintended consequences in the wrong terrain. </span><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">Loose wet </span><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">avalanches will not be listed as the primary loose snow avalanche problem</span><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">, but loose wet avalanches will be possible on steeper solar slopes especially during the odd sunbreak. </span><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">  </span></p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">Storm slabs should be a lower concern Thursday. Storm slabs will be more likely in areas that see subtle warming Thursday. During more intense showers Thursday, watch for graupel layers that can become bed surfaces for storm slabs. </p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.8px;""><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">Recently formed cornices have grown large. If traveling along ridgelines, be aware that cornices break much further back than expected and you don't want to go for a ride with a chunk of cornice. Despite the cool weather, cornice releases can be unpredictable during the spring.</span></p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Sunday:</h2>
                <p style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">Southwest flow should carry an energetic front and shortwave to the Northwest Saturday evening and night. Moderate west flow should carry a 2nd short wave, an upper low and a cool unstable air mass to the Northwest Sunday. This should cause southwest to west winds, rain or snow changing to snow showers and lowering snow levels on Sunday. Snow and snow showers should cause ball park about 12 inches of snow at Mt Hood by the end of the daylight hours on Sunday. There is a chance of thunderstorms in the forecast along the west slopes Sunday afternoon and evening.</p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">A mix of likely dangerous winter and spring avalanche conditions is likely at Mt Hood on Sunday. <span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">The sun is getting much stronger and new snow may be very reactive to solar effects. The greatest danger should be in the afternoon to the end of the daylight hours.</span></p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">New wind slab of a foot or more is likely on lee slopes mainly in the near and above treeline on Sunday. This is most likely on north to east slopes but possible on other aspects. Watch cracking and firmer or chalky w<span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">ind transported snow. Snow pits may not be helpful due to variability in the snowpack.</span></p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.8px;""><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">New storm slab layers will be likely in areas where there is rapidly accumulating snow for more than a few hours. Warming daytime temperatures may contribute to upside down layers and instability. Pay special attention to slope convexities where storm slab is mostly likely to be triggered.</span></p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.8px;""><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;""> Loose wet </span><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">avalanches may be possible on steep solar slopes on Sunday. Don't overstay your welcome if you start seeing pinwheels or small initial natural loose wet avalanches. Be aware of terrain traps where even a small loose avalanche could have unintended consequences if you venture out on Sunday.</span></p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Wednesday:</h2>
                <p style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">On Wednesday, persistent E-NE winds near and above treeline will slowly ease during the day and freezing levels should rise to around 10000 feet. Warmth and the late March sun will begin to shift the avalanche hazard to wet snow concerns Wednesday on Mt. Hood. High freezing levels, light winds and sunny skies over the next several days will increase the hazard, causing natural loose wet avalanches on solar aspects and increasing the odds for low likelihood/high consequence problems such as cornice failures.</p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">Due to the firm wind packed surfaces near and above treeline and continuing moderate E-NE winds in the morning, wet snow avalanches will be less likely than in the Washington Cascades.</p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">The loose wet potential will be greatest on steeper slopes below treeline. <span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">Melt-freeze crusts can quickly break down with intense spring sunshine. In areas that have received more recent snowfall, small loose wet avalanches have the potential to entrain deeper layers. Be aware of terrain traps where even a small loose wet avalanche could have unintended consequences. Plan to avoid steep solar slopes by late morning/mid-day to minimize the problem. </span>   </p>

<p style=""line-height: 20.8px;""><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">A mix of older wind slab on lee easterly aspects and newer wind slab on south through westerly aspects will make wind slab avalanches possible on a variety of aspects, primarily near and above treeline. Watch for cracking and firmer or chalky wind transported snow.  </span><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;""> </span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">Many areas have large cornices along ridge-lines so be </span>cognizant<span style=""line-height: 20.8px;""> of the hazard above. Unlike the loose wet problem, you may not have much notice that a cornice is about to fail. Cornices can break much further back on ridges than expected and releases can be unpredictable during the spring.</span></p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Friday:</h2>
                <p>Skies may partially clear Friday or feature filtered sunshine in the afternoon as a frontal system lifts north into British Columbia. Freezing levels should rise to around 10,000 ft Friday and alpine winds should fall off during the day.  Unlike the Washington Cascades, Mt. Hood will have significant storm related avalanche danger Friday. </p>

<p>Winds slabs will be found near and above treeline Friday and should be sensitive to human triggering. Avoid wind loaded slopes and watch for obvious clues like snowpack cracking. As winds veer to northerly above treeline Thursday night, snow will be transported to SW aspects. </p>

<p>Storm slab instabilities should be quick to settle out on Friday, but look for the greatest sensitivity through mid-day or in areas where graupel layers accumulated during heavier showers Thursday afternoon and may act as a bed surface. </p>

<p>Small loose wet avalanches are possible on steeper slopes involving new snow storm especially near and below treeline. Watch for wet snow deeper than your boot tops, especially on steep solar slopes during the late morning to afternoon hours. Even if skies remain mostly cloudy, strong solar input in mid-April will affect the snow surface on solar slopes.  </p>

<p>The potential for cornice releases should be low Friday but will increase through the weekend. Cornice releases can be unpredictable during the spring so avoid areas below cornices and remember that cornices can break much further back than expected along ridges.</p>

<p>Although not listed as an avalanche problem, large, powerful glide avalanches can release unexpectedly so avoid areas below steep unsupported slopes or rock faces showing glide cracks.</p>

Over this time period the snowpack has undergone significant settlement with lower elevation snow beginning to fade away and with an overall transition to a spring snowpack.</p>, '\n\n', <p>A front crossed the Northwest Tuesday afternoon and night. Then a cool upper and surface low pressure system moved east along the Washington-Oregon border on Wednesday and Thursday.

The potential for low probability/high consequence encounters, such as cornice failures and glide avalanches from steep unsupported slopes and smooth rock faces, should continue for awhile this spring. </p>, '\n\n', <p>The mid and lower snowpack along the west slopes should generally be a stable mix of crusts and layers of moist and rounded snow crystals.</p>, '\n\n', <p><strong>Recent Observations</strong></p>, '\n\n', <p>NWAC observer Laura Green was in the Heather, White and Mitchell Canyon areas in low visibility on Thursday 4/14. She found new building wind slab of 20-30 cm by late morning with shooting cracks on N-NE slopes at 6600 feet. Ski cuts were giving easy, small wind slab releases on slopes steeper than 30 degrees.</p>, '\n\n', <p>The Meadows pro-patrol gave the NWAC an extensive report for Friday 4/15. In the above treeline explosive control produced extensive wind slab releases on N-E slopes up to 4 feet deep running on the 4/12 crust. It was felt that these releases could have been triggered by skiers. In the near to above treeline they found ski triggered 4-6 inch wind slab also on N-E slopes but more limited in extent and some small ski triggered and natural loose wet avalanches on E-S slopes.</p>, '\n\n', <p>By Saturday the Meadows pro-patrol reported only some limited small loose wet avalanches in steep terrain. Ski conditions were bad off piste in about 5 inches of wet snow.</p>, '\n\n            ', <div class=""forecast-detailed"">
                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Sunday:</h2>
                <p>The upper ridge and warm air mass should further build over the US west coast on Sunday. This should cause light winds and mostly sunny weather in the Olympics and Cascades with further warming temperatures.</p>

<p>Sun and heat effects should be the main factors to consider on Sunday. From a couple of observations it seems like surface snow was probably pretty solidly refrozen in most areas on Saturday morning. But the refreeze may more limited Sunday morning due to warmer weather. If so then surface snow could get a better start on being available for loose wet snow avalanches.</p>

<p>Loose wet avalanches should remain possible Sunday on steeper slopes involving the recent snow. Watch for wet surface snow getting deeper than your boot tops. Triggered loose wet avalanches should be most likely on steep solar slopes but could be seen on any steep aspect in this warm weather. Avoid areas below steep gullies and run out zones that might be prone to natural loose wet avalanches.</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">The potential for cornice releases may increase through the warm weekend. Cornice releases are basically unpredictable so avoid areas below cornices and remember that cornices can break much further back than expected along ridges.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 20.8px;"">Although not listed as an avalanche problem, powerful glide avalanches can release unexpectedly so also avoid areas below steep unsupported slopes or rock faces especially if they are showing glide cracks. Glide cracks may be hidden by the recent snowfall.</span></p>

<p>Storm and winds slabs will not be listed as avalanche problems along the west slopes due to reports of good bonds of the recent snow to the 4/12 crust and fast stabilizing rates seen at this time of year. However, be aware of the potential for isolated slab avalanche layers involving the recent snow mainly on non-solar aspects of very high terrain.</p>

Saturday featured mostly cloudy skies and occasional light showers for the west slopes of the Cascades, Olympics and Mt. Hood area while the eastern slopes away from the Cascade crest saw mostly sunny skies. </p>, '\n\n', <p>For most of last week, freezing levels had averaged near or above 10,000 feet with strong spring sunshine. This was the third period in April with freezing levels above 10,000 feet. The cumulative effect of the warm stretches have helped establish good melt water drain channels in the snowpack with much of the<span style=""line-height: 20.8px;""> lower elevation snow continuing to melt away and generally transitioned us to a </span>homogeneous<span style=""line-height: 20.8px;""> spring snowpack throughout the region.</span><span style=""line-height: 1.6;""> </span></p>, '\n\n', <p>Storms in March built unusually large cornices along many ridges. While these have been melting back, many have failed recently, producing small and large wet snow avalanches on slopes below during the recent warm weather. The potential for low probability/high consequence encounters, such as cornice failures and glide avalanches from steep unsupported slopes and smooth rock faces, will continue this spring. </p>, '\n\n', <p>The mid and lower snowpack should generally be a stable mix of crusts and layers of moist and rounded snow crystals.</p>, '\n\n', <p><strong>Recent Observations</strong></p>, '\n\n', <p>WSDOT avalanche professionals working in the Chinook Pass area last week have, as expected under the hot weather, produced numerous small to moderate sized loose wet avalanches. The upper layers of the snowpack appear to be draining well and with daily melt-freeze cycles, avalanches have mainly involved the upper surface layers of snow up to about the top 6 inches. There were several natural cornice releases noted Tuesday and Wednesday, each producing wet slides on the slopes below. </p>, '\n\n', <p>NWAC observer Lee Lazzara covered a great deal of terrain in the Mt Baker backcountry earlier this week and noted similar conditions with all avalanche problems being heat related; cornices, glide avalanches on unsupported terrain features and small loose wet avalanches during the warm part of the day. The snowpack is quickly melting back in much of the terrain below treeline, making travel choices difficult for some lower elevation areas. Dallas Glass traveled above treeline out of Paradise Wednesday, and found that glide cracks were evident on a variety of aspects and elevations but no new releases. Laura Green toured in the Salmon River drainage of Mt. Hood Thursday and found a supportable melt-freeze crust slowly breaking down during the day near and above treeline and no significant avalanche concerns. Laura observed a fracture line of one large avalanche in the White River drainage that had likely occurred mid-week during the warm spell around the 9000 ft level. </p>, '\n\n', <p>Several west-side ski areas operating Saturday 4/23 noted no avalanche concerns under the cooler and cloudier conditions. </p>, '\n\n            ', <div class=""forecast-detailed"">
                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Sunday:</h2>
                <p>A frontal system passing through the Cascades Saturday night will bring light to moderate amounts of new snow to mid and higher elevations late Saturday night through Sunday. Westerly transport winds will be stronger and last longer at Mt. Hood than areas further north, adding the potential for wind slab development on the usual lee aspects. </p>

<p>Shallow storm slabs are possible mainly above treeline Sunday. Due to the refreezing snow surface and a cooling trend, new snow should generally bond well to wet snow or rough surface crusts. However, due to the showery regime in the cold air mass overhead Sunday, graupel layers are a probable bed surface for shallow slabs.  </p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Friday:</h2>
                <p>Diminishing wind and snow early Friday should give way to a few snow showers through the day. Freezing levels should remain relatively low Friday. Only light new snow accumulations are expected during the day Friday between weather systems.</p>

<p>This weather should allow for recent significant storm and wind slabs to begin slowly settling. However, don't let your early season enthusiasm catch you off guard. There have already been active avalanches toward the beginning of the current storm cycle and by Friday, storm layers may be significant and need ample time to settle.</p>

<p>The greatest danger should be in areas where the most significant storm snow has fallen, mainly volcanic peaks, particularly the Mt Baker area and Mt Rainier area. Watch for recent wind transported slab formations on lee terrain, ranging mainly from NW-ENE near ridges.</p>

<p>Caution at lower elevations with shallower snowcover for traps such as creeks, rocks and early season terrain hazards. </p>

<p>Any avalanche problems should be found in new snow layers. Watch for signs of firmer wind transported snow that indicate wind slab. Storm slab is most likely in areas that rapidly accumulate more than several inches of new snow.</p>

<p>A cooling trend should help give favorable right side up new snow profiles in sheltered areas where new snow does not accumulate too rapidly or too deeply.</p>

<p>In most areas in the below treeline band there is not enough snow yet for avalanches. Any avalanche problems would be only in the upper part of this band.</p>

<p>In much of the lower elevation, below treeline band, there is insufficient snow to produce avalanches, but watch for early season hazards such as rocks and creeks.  Avalanche problems should be limited to the upper part of this elevation band and higher elevations.</p>

<p>Small human triggered avalanches in many areas in the near and above treeline seems possible by later Friday at Mt Hood due to the alpine winds, new snow and the warming trend.</p>

<p>The below treeline danger has been raised to Considerable because storm slabs should be easily human triggered. Stick to lower angled slopes Sunday. </p>

<p><strong>Previous discussion: </strong></p>

<p>A strong frontal system will sweep through Mt. Hood late Saturday night through mid-day Sunday. This system should deliver a nice shot of snow to Mt. Hood with an overall cooling trend. </p>

<p>Despite a favorable cooling trend with this storm, westerly winds will build fresh wind slab on lee aspects near and above treeline. Look for wind slab development further downslope than you might expect due to locally strong winds and persistent loading. Watch for firm wind transported or hollow sounding snow. </p>

<p>Storm slab should be a lesser avalanche concern on Sunday. However, in wind protected areas that experience persistent and intense snowfall rates, locally sensitive storm slab may develop.   </p>

<p>In much of the lower part of the below treeline band there is still insufficient snow for avalanches, so watch for early season travel hazards such as terrain traps, rocks and open creeks. </p>

                <p>Several inches of low density snow may accumulate Monday as a weak front passes through the Cascades. Moderate westerly alpine winds are forecast to decrease slightly Sunday night but should still be strong enough to continue loading lee aspects near and above treeline with plenty of new low density snow available for transport. Storm slabs should be less sensitive on Monday, but sustained cold temperatures will help preserve recent storm snow instabilities. In particular watch for lingering storm or wind slab on lee aspects near and above treeline that can still be human triggered. Only wind slab will be listed in the avalanche problems moving forward.</p>

<p>In steep terrain where the new snow lacks a slab structure, watch for small loose dry avalanches near terrain traps like cliff bands where even small avalanches can have big consequences.     </p>

<p>In much of the lower part of the below treeline band there is still insufficient snow for avalanches, so watch for early season travel hazards such as terrain traps, rocks and open creeks. </p>

                <p>A lot is going to start happening on Thursday and regional timing of weather and avalanche conditions will be tricky.</p>

<p>South to southeast winds at Mt Hood should continue to increase Wednesday night in advance of an incoming front.</p>

<p>The front with increasing snow and a slight warming trend should begin to lift south to north over the Northwest starting in the south at Mt Hood on Thursday.</p>

<p>Watch for wind transport and new wind slab mainly on southwest to northeast aspects at Mt Hood on Thursday. But check for firmer wind transported snow on all aspects since confidence is not high on which aspects to highlight. The slight warming trend should enhance the formation of new wind slab on Thursday.</p>

<p>New storm slab also seems likely by the end of the day on Thursday in areas that rapidly accumulate snow. The slight warming trend should also enhance the formation of new storm slab on Thursday.</p>

<p>With deep unconsolidated snow in most areas, there is an increased risk for tree well and snow immersion suffocation at this time. Ride or ski with a partner and keep them in sight at all times!</p>

<p>Even though the lower part of the below treeline band is filling in, watch for early season travel hazards such as barely covered rocks and open creeks.</p>

<p>Further new wind and storm slab likely Thursday night. The warming trend should continue to enhance the formation of these layers.</p>

We've been hearing the term ""as good as it gets"" quite a lot lately!</p>, '\n\n', <p>Given the favorable snowpack profile, good bonds between older snow layers and a lack of deeper layer concerns, avalanche problems should be confined to the upcoming old snow/new snow interface or within new storm layering. </p>, '\n\n', <p>In areas not blasted by the easterly winds over the last 24 hours, near surface faceting and/or surface hoar is widespread. Considerable wind transport has occurred near and above treeline from Stevens Pass and south to the Crystal and Paradise environs. Less wind effect occurred in the Mt. Baker area. </p>, '\n\n', <p><strong>Recent Observations</strong></p>, '\n\n', <p>Multiple professional reports received Monday and Tuesday from the Stevens and Snoqualmie Pass areas, and above Paradise on Mt Rainier indicated that the storm related sensitivity experienced last Sunday had improved greatly. No slab like character was noted with a favorable density profile providing excellent surface snow conditions. These were areas where sensitive human triggered soft slab conditions were reported Sunday, indicating an improving stability trend.

Strong easterly winds have likely built sensitive but shallow wind slabs roughly from Stevens Pass and south to White Pass.

Tom also noted a melt freeze crust overlying buried surface hoar just below the surface on N through SE aspects near treeline - a potential bed surface/weak layer interface. A <a href=""http://www.nwac.us/observations/pk/481/"">similar report</a> came from a solar slope in the Chair Peak area of Snoqualmie Pass Wednesday. The bottom line is that we have new wind slab for much of the west slopes outside of the Mt.

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Friday:</h2>
                <p>Will we reach a tipping point on Friday with widespread sensitive slab development or will recent weak layers be buried and await the next storm to become active?  A first round of light to moderate snow Thursday night followed by increasing shower activity and a gradual warming trend Friday afternoon/evening should lead to an increasingly sensitive snowpack.</p>

<p>Dangerous avalanche conditions may develop on Friday. Look for new wind slab near and above treeline especially from Stevens Pass south to White Pass. All aspects will be listed due to variation in local loading patterns. Also, new snow may bond poorly to weak surface snow and become reactive by the end of Friday with increased loading and a gradual warming trend. The near-treeline band should be the trickiest to navigate where shallow new wind slab may have already buried recent weak surface snow. Above treeline and especially in the south-central Cascades including Crystal and Paradise new wind slabs should be the largest. New storm slabs may the most sensitive by the end of the day in the Mt. Baker area on all aspects. The Considerable danger rating will be the same throughout the west slopes, but the avalanche problems will vary slightly in the forecast zones.  </p>

<p>In steep sheltered terrain continue to watch for small loose dry avalanches near terrain traps like cliff bands where even small avalanches can have big consequences. If the warming trend doesn't materialize Friday, loose dry will be more likely than storm slabs. </p>

<p>With deep unconsolidated snow in many wind protected areas, there is an increased risk for tree well and snow immersion suffocation at this time. Ride or ski with a partner and keep them in sight at all times!</p>

<p>Even though the lower part of the below treeline band is filling in, watch for early season travel hazards such as barely covered rocks and open creeks.</p>

During this time, there have been many reports of right side up, favorable density profiles with lower density snow nearer the surface. The Washington Pass area in particular has enjoyed excellent skiing and riding conditions with good stability and light winds. Widespread near-surface faceting and surface hoar formation had been observed particularly in this area of the east slopes. The Mission Ridge area experienced moderate easterly winds through Thursday night before switching to moderate westerly winds early Friday morning. Moderate westerly winds continued at Mission Ridge on Saturday. </p>, '\n\n', <p>Light to locally moderate snowfall accumulated Thursday night through Saturday morning along the east slopes. Mission Ridge and Blewett Pass saw a few inches each day, but Holden Village and the Lyman Lake Snotel showed about 12-20 inches of new respectively. In the Southeast zone, Snotels averaged about 6-12 inches of new snow over the last 2 days ending Saturday morning.  A slow warming trend began Friday night and continued on Saturday, gradually dislodging the previous arctic air mass.  </p>, '\n\n', <p><strong>Recent Observations</strong></p>, '\n\n', <p>Pro-observer Jeff Ward was in the Washington Pass area Friday and reported up to 25 cm (10"") of new snowfall at Pass level by Friday afternoon. The new snow was of lower density but cohesive enough that easily and remotely triggered soft slabs were possible on all aspects with rapidly decreasing stability.</p>, '\n\n', <p>Mission Ridge pro-patrol reported the switch to westerly winds had loaded NE aspects below ridgetop on Friday. Easy to trigger wind slabs of 40 cm deep were observed on NE aspects around 6700 feet. Just a few hundred feet below in less wind affected terrain, the snowpack was generally right side up and lacked a cohesive slab. Avalanche concerns were confined to loaded slopes just below ridges again on Saturday in the Mission area. A shallow snowpack still locally limits the avalanche danger to the higher elevations and more wind loaded aspects.</p>, '\n\n            ', <div class=""forecast-detailed"">
                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Sunday:</h2>
                <p>Here we go again! With another round of light to moderate snow forecast Saturday night, followed by perhaps a brief break Sunday morning and then with renewed light snowfall Sunday afternoon, 24 hr snowfall totals along the east slopes through Sunday 4 pm should average 3-12 inches with the highest totals in the northeast zone near the Cascade crest. Snow levels should remain relatively stable on Sunday. W-SW transport winds should stay moderate especially for the central-east and southeast Washington Cascades.  </p>

<p>With this latest round of snowfall, we are betting that we have arrived at the breaking point where avalanche activity becomes widespread, with natural avalanches likely and human triggered very likely. Wind loading of lee slopes will push the avalanche danger to High near and above treeline, but expect sensitive conditions in all bands. Less snowfall in the central and southeast zones will likely keep the avalanche danger a notch lower in these zones. </p>

<p>Additional snowfall at moderated temperatures will aid in a more uniform slab structure throughout the east slopes,<strong> leading to soft storm slabs potentially failing on weak persistent grain types formed prior to this storm cycle. Storm slabs that initially fail within the new storm snow can step down to these increasingly deeper layers. Remote triggering of avalanches is possible with this snowpack structure. Choose low angled terrain and avoid slopes connected to avalanche paths with wind loaded start zones.</strong></p>

<p>Expect new wind slab near and above treeline in all zones especially on lee easterly aspects. Avoid all wind loaded terrain Sunday. In areas away from the crest, such as Blewett Pass and Mission Ridge, expect wind slab to be the primary avalanche problem on lee aspects near and above treeline. </p>

<p>Loose dry will not be listed as an avalanche problem, but in steep terrain lacking a slab structure, continue to watch for small loose dry avalanches near terrain traps like cliff bands where even small avalanches can have big consequences. </p>

                <p>Light snow showers should end Tuesday morning. A clearing trend should develop by Tuesday afternoon. Winds should be pretty light Tuesday with cold temperatures.</p>

<p>The avalanche danger is less than during the recent storm cycle but careful snowpack evaluation and cautious routefinding will still be essential on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Wind slab should be most likely to linger on north to southeast aspects due to recent southwest flow aloft. But watch for firmer wind transported snow on other aspects.</p>

<p>Storm slabs in many areas that had r sustained heavy snowfall should further settle on Tuesday.</p>

<p>There is a confirmed persistent weak layer from about December 8th in the Washington Cascades from about December 8th. This type of layer is less common at Mt Hood and it won't be listed here as an avalanche problem. We don't have any snowpack observations identifying a persistent weak layer at Mt Hood. But ratchet back your plans if you experience deep cracking, collapsing or whoomping. Some time and snowpack tests from many areas will be needed to determine to what extent this layer is a regional problem.</p>

<p>Loose dry avalanches will not be listed as an avalanche problem on Tuesday. But in steep terrain lacking a slab structure continue to watch for small loose dry avalanches near terrain traps like cliff bands where even small avalanches can have big consequences. </p>

<p>With deep unconsolidated snow in many wind protected areas there remains a risk for tree well and snow immersion suffocation at this time. Ride or ski with a partner and keep them in sight at all times!</p>

<p>Even though the lower part of the below treeline band is filling in watch for early season travel hazards such as barely covered rocks and open creeks.</p>

<p>The regional avalanche danger is expected to further slightly decrease on Wednesday. But it is expected that southeast to east winds will transport snow and build new wind slab on Wednesday.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Thursday:</h2>
                <p><strong>Thursday morning update: </strong></p>

<p>Up to 12 inches of new snow accumulated from Wednesday afternoon through early Thursday morning. This new snow accumulated along with a slight warming trend and switch from east to west winds. Due to shifting winds over the last week, expect wind slab to be found on a variety of aspects above treeline. In addition, there is some uncertainty about the potential for previously formed wind slabs formed earlier this week that may be unlikely to trigger but could still produce larger and more dangerous avalanches above treeline. </p>

<p><strong>Previous discussion: </strong></p>

<p>A low pressure and frontal system will pass by to the south across Oregon and north California on Wednesday. This system will cause southeast winds at Mt Hood and snow late Wednesday.</p>

<p>Light snow showers should end Thursday morning with lighter winds and continued cool temperatures.</p>

<p>New local wind slab is possible on Thursday depending on the local strength of the east to southeast winds. This should be mainly on northeast to southwest aspects at Mt Hood. Older wind slab from the latest storm cycle should have mostly stabilized so the northeast to southwest aspects will be indicated. But watch for firmer wind transported snow on all aspects mainly near and above treeline.</p>

<p>The may be enough new snow at Mt Hood late Wednesday to cause some shallow new storm slab. Evaluate snow carefully if you find yourself in an area with where there has been more than a few inches of rapidly accumulated snow.</p>

<p>A report from Stevens Pass indicates the December 8th layer is still possibly reactive in the Washington Cascades but we don't have any evidence of a persistent weak layer at Mt Hood. This type of layer is less common at Mt Hood and it won't be listed here as an avalanche problem. But head for lower angle slopes and ratchet back your plans if you experience collapsing or whoomping or have evidence of this layer such as from snowpits.</p>

<p>Loose dry avalanches from snow from the latest storm aren't expected to still be an avalanche problem. But in steep terrain lacking a slab structure continue to watch for small loose dry avalanches near terrain traps like cliff bands where even small avalanches can have big consequences. </p>

<p>With deep unconsolidated snow in sheltered areas there remains a risk for tree well and snow immersion suffocation. When near trees ride or ski with a partner and keep them in sight at all times!</p>

<p>Even though the lower part of the below treeline band is filling in, watch for early season travel hazards such as barely covered rocks and open creeks.</p>

These winds were strong enough to build fresh wind slabs on more atypical SW-NW facing terrain, mainly near and especially above tree line.</p>, '\n\n', <p>There has been about 4-8 inches of snowpack settlement since the storm cycle ended, allowing underlying or storm snow related weak layers to stabilize.</p>, '\n\n', <p>Light to moderate west winds are seen at NWAC station along the east slopes on Saturday such as Washington Pass and Mission Ridge and along the crest such as Crystal Mountain and White Pass. These winds may give some transport to mainly NE to SE aspects.</p>, '\n\n', <p>Several clear nights with light winds this week have also allowed for weak surface snow development.

The Stevens pro-patrol reports it was on a steep SSW slope at 5400 feet with a 40 cm x 100 foot crown releasing in buried hoar frost and facets on a crust.

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Sunday:</h2>
                <p>Light snow showers may resume at higher elevations along the east slopes on Sunday with light to moderate west winds. A slight warming trend should be seen by Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>A broad brush will be used and all aspects will be indicated for wind slab on Sunday. The greatest danger along the east slopes should be in the Northeast zone where the most transport and greatest snowpack sensitivity was seen on Friday. But watch for firmer wind transported snow on all aspects in all the east slope zones due to recent varied winds especially above treeline.</p>

<p>Light snow showers on Sunday may further bury intact a variety of weak surface snow types formed this week under fair cold weather. This is likely to become a weak layer starting Monday.</p>

<p>The December 8th layer continues to round and gain strength and should be less sensitive to trigger.  Head for lower angle slopes and ratchet back your plans if you experience collapsing or whumpfing or have evidence of this layer such as from snowpits.</p>

<p>Even though the lower part of the below treeline band is filling in, watch for early season travel hazards such as barely covered rocks and open creeks.</p>

<p>Note that the first in a series of storms is expected to begin to move across the Northwest Sunday night. This will bring a significantly increasing avalanche danger by Monday.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Tuesday:</h2>
                <p>Strong westerly flow will carry another strong frontal system across the Northwest Monday night and Tuesday morning. This will cause strong winds with moderate to heavy snow along the west slopes and a warming trend overnight. The warming trend should contribute to the formation of both new wind slab and new storm slab layers. A sharp cooling trend will take place beginning late Tuesday morning with light to moderate snow showers continuing through the day in continued strong westerly flow. See the <a href=""http://www.nwac.us/mountain-weather-forecast/current/"">NWAC mountain weather forecast </a>for more details on precipitation intensity, precipitation types and temperature trends.</p>

<p>New wind slab is very likely for Mt. Hood on Tuesday. Continued wind transport will deepen these layers mainly on lee north to southeast slopes but wind slab is possible on other aspects due to strong gusts. Also, wind slab may develop below treeline due to the persistence of very strong westerly winds. </p>

<p>New storm slab is also very likely Tuesday on any slopes that rapidly accumulate new snow. A change from snow to rain near and below treeline Monday night will also make storm slabs more likely to initiate or cause natural loose wet avalanches in areas lacking a slab structure. Loose wet should only be likely in the morning due to a rapid cool down beginning later Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>A natural avalanche cycle should occur Monday night through Tuesday morning during peak warming and precipitation. Expect wind loading further downslope than usual due to strong westerly winds on a variety of aspects. Slabs may fail on weak persistent grain types formed prior to this storm cycle. Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended Tuesday! </p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Wednesday:</h2>
                <p>Shallow storm slabs should have settled out by Wednesday, shifting the focus to lingering wind slab and our new persistent slab problem. </p>

<p>We know in at least one area, Stevens Pass, that recently buried surface hoar from 12/17 was buried intact and sensitive in snowpit tests. Strengthening crusts found at lower elevations and in the southeast Cascades that experienced more warming may limit how sensitive this layer will be to human triggering. For elevations that did not see rain, wind loaded slopes could present the dangerous combination of a deeper slab overlying a persistent weak layer. We need more information about the sensitivity and spatial distribution of the 12/17 PWL throughout the east slopes, but based on limited observations and weather station data, persistent slabs are more likely an issue for the central and northeast Cascades. The 12/8 layer should have received a decent test during this last storm cycle and unless we receive information that this layer is reactive, we will focus on PWLs closer to the surface and more likely to be human triggered. </p>

<p>We know wind loading occurred into the below treeline band due to the strong and persistent westerly winds during the last storm cycle. While wind slab will most likely be found lee easterly aspects, the gusty nature of this recent event may have built wind slab on a variety of aspects. Be suspicious of any wind loaded slope Wednesday, especially one that might harbor the combination of wind slab and a persistent weak layer. </p>

<p>Choose conservative and low consequence terrain and evaluate the snowpack carefully Wednesday before committing to any avalanche terrain. Persistent weak layers lurk below the most recent storm snow and may be sensitive to human triggering. Observe local wind loading patterns and allow for wind slab even into the below treeline band. </p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Friday:</h2>
                <p>A weak front will move across the Northwest Cascades late Thursday. This should cause southwest winds and a cooling trend. Snowfall should be pretty light except with 5-10 inches looking likely in the Mt Baker area.

<p>Wind slab should be the primary problem Friday. Southwest winds in the last storm cycle and for the late Thursday system make this most likely on north to southeast slopes. Watch for firmer wind transported snow mainly north to southeast slopes.  New or recent wind slab could also be more reactive where it builds over a hard smooth crust.</p>

<p>Several inches or more of new snow make new storm slab possible at Mt Hood on Friday. Watch for new storm slab in areas that experience rapidly accumulating snow deeper than a few inches. New storm slab could also be more reactive where it builds over a hard smooth crust.</p>

<p>The surface crust formed in some areas following the storms early this week is reported to be strong and hard enough to present an out of control fall danger. Avoid steep hard slopes where there will be fall consequences if you are not confident you can manage this problem by walking or using ski or boot crampons.</p>

Storm totals generally ranged from 6 - 12 inches along the east slopes during this cycle. Westerly winds were especially strong with the 2nd system late Monday night and into Tuesday with gusty winds mixing down into usually more wind sheltered terrain. </p>, '\n\n', <p>After a fair weather period midweek another front crossed the Northwest on Thursday followed by an upper trough on Friday with low snow levels. About 1-5 inches of snow accumulated along the east slopes. </p>, '\n\n', <p>Scattered snow showers were seen mainly near the crest with ample sunbreaks and generally light winds on Saturday with fair and cold weather seen on Christmas Day. </p>, '\n\n', <p><strong>Recent Observations</strong></p>, '\n\n', <p>NWAC pro-observer Jeff Ward was in the Icicle Creek area up to about 6300 feet on Wednesday and saw evidence of a widespread natural wind slab avalanche cycle during the last storm, with one very large crown seen on a north aspect. The December 17th persistent weak layer (PWL) was found at 15-30 cm below the surface on W to N to E slopes. The layer was unreactive both in large column snowpack tests, ski tests and cornice drops.</p>, '\n\n', <p>The NCMG on Friday and Saturday at Washington Pass had some planar hand shears in wind affected snow but the only instability directly noted was small loose dry avalanches in steep rocky terrain. The 12/17 interface was found to be unreactive in several snowpack tests. </p>, '\n\n', <p>NWAC observer Tom Curtis was on DirtyFace Peak near Lake Wenatchee Saturday and found the 12/17 PWL 15-25 cm down but not propagating in snowpack tests on N-E-SE aspects between 4000-5500 feet. Tom also found shallow and stubborn wind slab in the near treeline band. </p>, '\n\n', <p>A different story continues to evolve in the Mission Ridge area. On Wednesday avalanche mitigation produced 1.5 -3 ft hard slab avalanches in 3 separate paths! These avalanches were releasing on basal facets about 15 cm from the ground. On Thursday, snowpits on W-N-E slopes at 6500 ft continued to show hard slab layers giving hard compression test results with moderate quality shears on facets about 15 cm from the ground with about 120 cm (4 ft) of total snow. On Saturday, a backcountry ski tourer in the Lake Clara area near Mission Ridge reported a huge whumpfing noise, likely indicating a collapse of the basal facets. While no avalanche occurred, the terrain where the collapse occurred connected to a large avalanche path that was NE facing near treeline. While deep persistent slabs in this area are unlikely to trigger, they warrant a high level of caution before venturing near or into avalanche terrain. </p>, '\n\n            ', <div class=""forecast-detailed"">
                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Monday:</h2>
                <p>After a benign start to Monday, an incoming frontal system will quickly spread light rain and snow over the Cascades with precipitation beginning around mid-day for the northeast Cascades and Monday afternoon for the south and central-east Cascades. Above treeline winds will quickly ramp up in the afternoon. Expect stormy conditions Monday night with increasing avalanche danger. </p>

<p>Fresh wind slab should begin to develop Monday afternoon near and especially above treeline on lee aspects.</p>

<p>Shallow storm slabs may develop in the Washington Pass area by late Monday afternoon as the storm intensifies. </p>

<p>The latest tests of the December 17th PWL in the Cascades don't seem to indicate a regionally reactive layer. However, since this layer is still showing the ability to propagate in snowpack tests throughout much of the range, we still advise observing the snowpack structure in your local area and skiing or riding on lower angled slopes until there is more certainty that this layer is no longer a problem. While triggering this layer seems unlikely, remember that persistent weak layers are generally involved in larger avalanches.</p>

<p>Of particular concern is the low-likelihood/high consequence threat of deep persistent slabs in the Mission Ridge area consisting of hard slabs failing on weak layers near the ground - a deadly combination. We recommend a very cautious approach with conservative terrain selection in the Mission Ridge area in light of this local problem. </p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Thursday:</h2>
                <p>West southwest flow aloft will carry the next front across the Northwest on Thursday afternoon and night. Winds should increase in most areas on Thursday but significant new snow during the daylight hours is expected mainly in the Olympics and northwest Cascades. A warming trend should also be seen with temperature inversions possible Thursday in the central west and southwest Cascades.</p>

<p>Further snow should be seen in the Washington Cascades Thursday night.</p>

<p>Recent and renewed west to southwest winds make wind slab most likely on northwest to southeast aspects on Thursday. This is most likely by the end of the day in the northwest zone. Wind slab may build further anywhere there is still snow available for wind transport in wind exposed areas.</p>

<p>New storm slab is also most likely in the Northwest zone due to new snow and the warming trend on Thursday. Storm slab in less likely in the central west and southwest zone but lingering storm slab is possible there.</p>

<p>The 12/17 PWL persistent slab problem still warrants attention in the Cascades mainly in areas without the Solstice crust layer. Recent and new loading may make this layer more sensitive to triggering where it is still present. Remember that persistent weak layers are generally involved in larger avalanches. Avoid steeper slopes in areas where you still find this layer in snow pits.</p>

<p>Wind slab should be the primary avalanche problem due to a period of moderate to strong westerly winds Thursday afternoon and/or Thursday night that may load leeward aspects further downslope than usual. Treat wind loaded slopes in all elevation bands with caution on Friday.</p>

<p>Storm slabs are expected to be the most reactive and likely to trigger Thursday night during peak warming and storm intensity. However, sensitive storm slabs may linger and be found in wind sheltered terrain Friday. More snow is expected from Snoqualmie Pass and north to Washington Pass with this storm and the avalanche danger will be rated higher to account for the additional expected snowfall. Lower snowfall totals are expected further east of the crest and in the southeast zone.</p>

<p>The persistent slab problem still warrants attention in the Cascades especially in the Mission Ridge area where recent full depth avalanches have occurred. Recent and new loading may make this layer more sensitive to triggering where it is still present. Remember that persistent weak layers are generally involved in larger avalanches.

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Saturday:</h2>
                <p>After a mostly clear start to Saturday for much of the Cascades, a fast moving frontal system will bring light snow to the northeast Cascades by late morning and spread south to the central and southeast Cascades in the afternoon. New snow amounts through 4 pm will generally be light to insignificant, but westerly winds above treeline are expected spike up by mid-day. There is ample new snow available for transport along the east slopes closer to the crest. </p>

<p>Wind slab should be the primary avalanche problem and mainly found near and above treeline Saturday. Wind slab should be less likely to trigger throughout the Cascades but look for wind loaded slopes further downslope than usual particularly in the Mission Ridge/Blewett area.</p>

<p>The persistent slab problem still warrants attention in the Mission Ridge/Blewett area where several PWLs represent a touchy snowpack. Remember that persistent weak layers are generally involved in larger avalanches. Avoid steeper slopes in areas where you still find this layer in snow pits or especially if you experience direct observations of this layer such as whumpfing or shooting cracks. </p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Monday:</h2>
                <p><strong>Update Monday morning for the central east and southeast zone: The NWAC Blewett Pass and Mission Ridge stations, the Mission Ridge pro-patrol and Snotels in the southeast Cascades report 1-3 feet of new snow on Monday morning. Further moderate to heavy snow seems possible in these areas Monday morning. Along with strong E-NE winds this should make new wind slab likely or very likely on lee mainly west to south slopes. Storm slab is also likely or very likely on most slopes. The avalanche forecast for these areas will be updated to high in the near and above treeline and considerable in the below treeline in the central east and southeast zones.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In the northeast zone:</strong>: snow showers should give way to clearing skies and continued cold temperatures. Strong NE-E ridgetop winds should continue to transport the ample loose surface snow and build touchy wind slabs on more non-traditional or unusual SE-SW aspects, mainly above tree line and possibly near tree line.</p>

<p>Deep, low density snow will make sluffs or loose slides likely on steep wind sheltered slopes. Watch for travel on steep slopes above terrain traps, such as cliffs or creeks where the entertainment of loose snow may bury someone caught more deeply. </p>

<p>Fresh, touchy wind slabs near ridges and non traditional aspects, will be the primary avalanche problem on Monday. Wind affected snow should be widespread Monday, especially with strong shifting winds, watch for wind transported snow on a variety of aspects and cross loaded features.</p>

<p>Along all of the east slopes the 12/17 PWL persistent slab problem is gaining strength, becoming more deeply buried and less sensitive in snowpack tests. However, continue to avoid large open terrain in areas where an overall shallow snowpack exists, or where you find this layer in snow pits, especially if you experience direct observations such as whumpfing or shooting cracks. </p>

                <p>A weakening upper trough should linger over the Northwest on Tuesday. Meanwhile a cold Arctic air mass will slowly push further south over the BC-Montana area causing cold offshore surface flow over the Northwest. Alpine NE winds should ease a bit but not go away on Tuesday. Low clouds from the Columbia Basin will still probably affect the south Cascades on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The recent shift to NE winds makes new wind slab most likely on NW to SE aspects on Tuesday. This should be most likely in the south Cascades and Mt Hood. Watch for firmer wind transported snow mainly on lee NW to SE slopes at exposed alpine locations. Remember that stiffer wind slab has the potential to propagate to larger avalanches. But since winds have shifted the past couple days don't let your guard down and watch for wind transported snow on other slopes as well.</p>

<p>New storm slab is also possible at Mt Hood due to recent significant snowfall ending Monday morning.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Wednesday:</h2>
                <p><strong>Forecast updated for east slopes of the Cascades and Mt. Hood Wednesday morning to extend Considerable rating into the near treeline band due to moderate to strong E-NE winds overnight and ample low density snow available for transport to build new and sensitive wind slab.  </strong></p>

<p><strong>Previous discussion:</strong> Fair cold weather is generally expected to continue over the Olympics and Cascades on Wednesday. Low clouds will probably linger from the Columbia Basin to the Cascade east slopes and the east side of Mt Hood.</p>

<p>But expect locally strong east winds to develop over the Olympics and Washington Cascades Tuesday night and Wednesday. Therefore new or further building wind slab should be the main avalanche problem on Wednesday. This new wind slab should be found mainly on NW to SE aspects on Wednesday especially at exposed locations such as around Snoqualmie, Crystal Mountain, Paradise and White Pass. There should be quite a bit of recent snow available for transport. Watch for firmer wind transported snow and remember that stiffer wind slab has the potential to propagate to larger avalanches.</p>

<p>Although NW to SE aspects will be indicated in the wind slab avalanche problem diagram remember to watch for firmer wind transported snow on all slope aspects or cross loaded slopes especially in areas with varied terrain and modified wind directions. Older wind slab may also linger on other slope aspects.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Monday:</h2>
                <p><strong>Monday morning update:</strong> Storm slabs have been reported as locally sensitive in the Mt. Baker area by pro-patrol with easily triggered 12-14"" storm slabs releasing on all aspects. Give new snow time to settle and stabilize today and choose more conservative terrain in the Mt. Baker area.</p>

<p>New snow by Monday morning along the west slopes should be up to about the 5-10 inch range. Temperatures will be cooler by Monday morning.</p>

<p>Southwest winds aloft should decrease on Monday. Light snow showers along the west slopes should decrease on Monday with further cooling.</p>

<p>If you travel into the back country Monday watch for new wind slab mainly on northwest to southeast slopes mainly in the near and above treeline. Previous wind slab may linger on other slope aspects also mainly in the near and above treeline. Watch for firmer wind transported snow.</p>

<p>New storm slab is possible Monday on sheltered slopes where there was more than several inches of rapidly accumulating snowfall.</p>

<p>New wind and storm slab layers should be more stable by the end of the day on Monday.</p>

<p>Remember that recently formed surface hoar and surface faceted snow has been seen lately in the below treeline. It will be a good plan to avoid slopes above terrain traps in the below treeline where these weak layers may have been buried by new snow.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Tuesday:</h2>
                <p>A weak low pressure system crossing Oregon on Tuesday should produce light snowfall for the south Washington Cascades and Mt. Hood through early afternoon.</p>

<p>However, a deeper low pressure system approaching the Oregon Coast later Tuesday should cause shifting winds throughout the Cascade range including Mt. Hood by Tuesday afternoon that will begin to build new wind slabs on unusual aspects especially near and above treeline. Previous wind slab may linger on other slope aspects also in the near and above treeline bands. Watch for firmer wind transported snow on a variety of aspects if you push higher in the terrain Tuesday.</p>

<p>Storm slabs may be sensitive on Tuesday especially in areas where they overlie recently buried weak layers below treeline. Remember that recently formed surface hoar and surface faceted snow was observed in the below treeline band heading into the last storm cycle. Until more information is received, avoid slopes above terrain traps in the below treeline band where these weak layers may have been buried by the most recent snowfall. </p>

<p>A low pressure system crossing Oregon Tuesday night will cause a sustained round of moderate easterly winds through Wednesday morning.

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Thursday:</h2>
                <p>High pressure should cause a clear, cold night Wednesday and a sunny day Thursday with light winds and cold temperatures. There has been low density snow available for recent transport and with the expected cold temperatures, wind slabs will be slow to settle and stabilize. </p>

<p>The fresh wind slabs could be found on a wide variety of aspects due to the recent shifting winds, from easterly to southwesterly. Therefore, watch for cross-loaded slopes, especially above treeline due to westerly winds higher on the volcano creating wind slabs on a variety of aspects. Watch for firmer wind transported snow and avoid freshly loaded slopes in all elevation bands.</p>

<p>Small loose dry avalanches are possible in steep wind sheltered terrain, but will not be listed as an avalanche problem. </p>

<p>A low pressure system crossing Oregon Tuesday night will cause a sustained round of moderate easterly winds through Wednesday morning. Light snowfall should taper off in the morning for the southeast and central-east Washington Cascades with clearer conditions expected over the northeast Cascades. Winds will not be nearly as strong as the east wind event of last week, but there is low density snow available for transport and cold temperatures Wednesday will help preserve any new instabilities.</p>

<p>Small loose dry avalanches are possible in steep wind sheltered terrain but will not be listed as an avalanche problem. Small loose wet avalanches will also be possible on steeper solar aspects Sunday. </p>

This allowed a rain or melt freeze crust to form in some areas below treeline before 5-15 inches of snow accumulated through Monday 1/9.  </p>, '\n\n', <p>A weak low pressure system, tracking across Oregon Tuesday morning through Wednesday afternoon, deposited another 3-6 inches of snow with light winds from Stevens Pass and southward, with Paradise adding another 12 inches. A period of strong E to NE winds increased Tuesday afternoon through early Wednesday before diminishing Wednesday afternoon.</p>, '\n\n', <p>An upper ridge over the northeast Pacific Ocean has caused fair weather Thursday through Sunday over the Olympics and Cascades with mostly light winds and moderating temperatures west of the crest and at higher elevations. Paradise reached into the 40s on Saturday and Sunday while strong temperature inversions and breezy cold east winds were seen in the Passes.  </p>, '\n\n', <p>Surface hoar and near surface faceting has been noted widely throughout the range in sun and wind sheltered locations below treeline. Sun crusts have formed on steeper solar aspects over the last few days. The best riding and skiing conditions have generally been reported in less wind and sun affected areas below treeline during this stretch of fair weather.</p>, '\n\n', <p><strong>Recent Observations</strong></p>, '\n\n', <p>NWAC pro-observers Dallas and Ian Nicholson were in the Crystal backcountry Wednesday to assess the distribution and sensitivity of fresh wind slabs from recent strong E-NE winds. They found that wind slabs were becoming larger as they moved into the near tree line band and exposed ridges. NE-E-SE facing slopes were stripped of recent snow with new reactive wind slabs on N-W-S facing terrain and cross loaded features. In wind sheltered terrain below treeline, the storm snow was right side up and lacked slab structure with excellent skiing conditions.</p>, '\n\n', <p>Some reports are available via the NWAC Observations page for Wednesday and Thursday. in summary skiers triggered wind slab layers on Mt Herman near Mt Baker and in the Slot Couloir on Mt Snoqualmie on Wednesday. Potential wind slab layers were noted at Stevens and at Snoqualmie on Thursday but no avalanches were triggered.</p>, '\n\n', <p>NWAC pro-observer Jeremy Allyn was out in the Alpental Valley on Friday and mainly found that recently formed wind slab in the near and above treeline was settling and strengthening.</p>, '\n\n', <p>Lee Lazarra was taking observations for NWAC in Glacier Creek, NW of Mt. Baker proper on Saturday. Lee found generally good riding conditions in the trees on non-solar aspects. Solar aspects were softening and likely to form sun crusts overnight. Snow surfaces just below and along ridges were variable from last week's winds and Lee found recent wind slab to be unlikely to trigger in his specific area. Widespread surface hoar growth was noted in usual spots like creek beds, but surface hoar size diminished higher in the below treeline band. </p>, '\n\n            ', <div class=""forecast-detailed"">
                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Monday:</h2>
                <p>Light rain and snow should develop for the north Cascades in the afternoon while only a general increase in afternoon clouds should be seen for the central and south Washington Cascades. Mild freezing levels will continue Monday with temperature inversions in the Passes and sheltered valleys. Alpine winds out of the SW are forecast to ramp up Monday afternoon.  </p>

<p>Little change in the avalanche danger is expected Monday with recent wind slabs primarily found on N-W-S aspects. However increasing SW winds in the above treeline band may start to form shallow wind slabs on more easterly aspects. Remember that firmer wind transported snow is always your best sign of wind slab layers.</p>

<p>Small loose wet avalanches will be possible on steeper solar aspects Monday for areas in the south and central Cascades that see sunshine. However, loose wet avalanches will only be listed in the north Cascade zone where light rain below 4000 feet is expected in the afternoon. </p>

<p><strong>Avalanche watch issued Monday night through Tuesday: </strong>A drastic change in the weather pattern to wetter and milder weather should substantially increase the avalanche danger either Monday night or Tuesday.  </p>

<p>Heavy precipitation with a warming trend Monday night will most likely impact the north Cascades including the Mt. Baker area. A natural avalanche cycle should occur Monday night.</p>

<p>From Stevens Pass and southward to White Pass, precipitation amounts, type and timing are less certain and High avalanche danger may occur Tuesday or not until Tuesday night.  </p>

<p>An abundance of weak and cold snow in the upper snowpack combined with the potential for rapid warming and high precipitation rates would lead to very dangerous avalanche conditions during this period and backcountry travel is not recommended. Check the forecast Monday evening for updates. </p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Wednesday:</h2>
                <p><strong>An avalanche warning is in effect through Wednesday afternoon.</strong></p>

<p>Along the east slopes expect strong winds and snow with warmer temperatures through Wednesday afternoon. The warmer temperatures will potentially allow denser heavier wind or storm slab to further build over lower density snow layers.This will further build potentially deep new wind and storm slab along the east slopes.</p>

<p>An abundance of weak and cold snow in the upper snowpack especially near and below treeline combined with further warming and high precipitation rates should lead to very dangerous avalanche conditions during this period along the east slopes and backcountry travel is not recommended. </p>

<p>The 12/17 PWL and other persistent weak layers closer to the surface have been unreactive as of late. If this layers does not snow reactivity during the current storm cycle it will be removed as an avalanche problem.</p>

Out ahead of this frontal band, there should be a period of moderate E-SE winds affecting again mainly the south and central Cascades. </p>

<p>Storm slabs may be the most prevalent in the Mt. Baker zone Friday morning due to moderate snowfall rates Thursday afternoon and evening. Storm slabs may also be locally sensitive in the Passes if poorly bonded to an underlying freezing rain crust. Give these layers time to settle and approach steeper slopes with caution.</p>

<p>A period of moderate E-SE winds Friday may build new wind slab near and above treeline on westerly aspects, especially in places with lower density snow available for transport. All aspects are indicated to cover older wind slab on more easterly aspects. Look for recent wind effects near and below ridgelines.</p>

<p>Allow existing wind slabs time to continue stabilizing on Saturday. Wind slabs are most likely on N-W-SW aspects due to recent E-SE transport winds but will be listed on all aspects due to variable loading patterns during the last few days. Look for recent wind effects near and below ridgelines and treat wind loaded slopes with caution. </p>

<p>Storm slabs will not be listed in the south Cascades zone where there has been less recent snow above the rain crust.  </p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Tuesday:</h2>
                <p>Fair weather should be seen Tuesday with light winds and little change in temperatures.</p>

<p>These conditions should allow for continued gradual decrease in avalanche danger as recent wind and storm slabs further settle and further stabilize. </p>

<p>Recently formed wind slab should further stabilize on Tuesday.  Wind slabs are most likely on SW-W-NE aspects due to recent strong E-SE winds. Watch for recent wind effects near and below ridgelines and avoid steep slopes with obvious signs of recent wind loading.</p>

<p>Storm slabs should become more stubborn to trigger Tuesday. Head for lower angle slopes if you encounter denser snow over weaker storm snow.</p>

<p>The 12/17 PWL and other persistent weak layers closer to the surface have been unreactive lately in the northeast zone and persistent slabs have been removed from that zone. However, the basal facets in the Mission Ridge area continue to occasionally produce alarming results either in snowpack tests or more recently with very large hard slab avalanches released during control work at Mission Ridge on specific wind loaded slopes. Continue to think about the possibility of low likelihood/high consequence persistent slab avalanches in this area when choosing terrain.  </p>

<p>Storm slabs should become more unlikely and more stubborn to trigger Wednesday and will be removed as an avalanche problem.</p>

<p>It should be cloudier on Wednesday than the past couple days and further loose wet avalanches seem unlikely. Loose wet avalanches will not be listed as an avalanche problem. Watch for loose wet snow conditions on steep solar slopes if there is unexpected significant sunshine on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

                <p>Sunshine or filtered sun through mainly high clouds is expected Friday with light winds and a continued warming trend.   </p>

<p>Watch for loose wet snow conditions on steep solar slopes during sun breaks or thin high clouds, especially during the warmest part of the day, Friday afternoon. </p>

<p>With recent observations showing wind slabs bonding and stabilizing, we will lower the sensitivity to unlikely.   Any lingering older wind slabs will continue to strengthen and stabilize Friday. Lingering wind slabs may be found on a variety of aspects due shifting winds Tuesday night. Watch for recent wind effects near and below ridgelines and avoid steep slopes with obvious signs of recent wind loading.</p>

                <p>A pattern change will begin to take place over the Northwest on Friday.

<p>Wind slab formed by strong E-NE winds on Wednesday and Thursday will linger on Friday. The primary aspects for these wind slabs should be any W facing slopes but could be found on other aspects.</p>

<p>New sensitive wind slab is likely to begin forming as shower bands of snow begin to move across the Cascades on Friday with a slight warming trend. The primary aspects for these wind slabs should be NW to SE facing slopes except for W facing slopes in the Cascade Passes.</p>

<p>Wind slab may be more touchy in areas where poorly bonded poorly to an underlying crust or firm old layer. Watch for firmer wind transported snow in all elevation bands especially in open terrain in the upper elevations of the below treeline band. All aspects are listed for wind slabs to account for the strength of recent winds and for any lingering older wind slabs formed over the weekend.  </p>

<p>New storm slab is also likely to begin forming on Friday on more sheltered slopes in areas that see more than a few inches of rapidly accumulating snow. The warming trend will help build upside down layers and promote storm slab formation.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Saturday:</h2>
                <p>A very important pattern change is taking place over the Northwest Friday and Saturday. The dry weather and strong cold E-NE winds seen Wednesday and Thursday are being replaced by increasing strong southwest flow aloft, increasing snow and warmer temperatures Friday and Saturday.</p>

<p>Saturday at Mt Hood should be a day of strong southwest alpine winds, moderate to heavy snow with snow changing to rain at lower elevations, and warming temperatures.</p>

<p>At Mt Hood at higher elevations from Friday to the end of the day on Saturday there should be 1-2 feet of warmer, denser new snow. This will generally build new upside down wind and storm slab layers. This new snow may build over weak or faceted snow from the cold weather mid-week on some or many slopes.</p>

<p>This is a recipe for avalanches.</p>

<p>An avalanche warning has been issued for Mt Hood for Saturday.</p>

<p>New sensitive wind slab is very likely on NW to SE slopes on Saturday.</p>

<p>Wind slab formed by strong E-NE winds on Wednesday and Thursday may linger on Saturday. The primary aspects for these wind slabs should be W facing slopes.</p>

<p>New sensitive potentially deep storm slab will continue to build on sheltered slopes on Saturday in areas that see rapidly accumulating snow. The warming trend will help build upside down layers and promote storm slab formation.</p>

<p>Natural or triggered wind and storm slab avalanches are very likely at Mt Hood on Saturday. Wind or storm slab avalanches may step to deeper layers. Rain at the lower elevations may also trigger loose wet or wet slab avalanches on Saturday.  Travel in back country avalanche terrain is not recommended at Mt Hood on Saturday.</p>

<p>Despite a slight cooling trend, new and recently formed storm slabs should still be sensitive Sunday. While storm slabs are most likely to release within the most recent storm layers, various crusts are capable of providing bed surfaces for larger avalanches. </p>

<p>We've highlighted more traditional lee easterly aspects on the elevation/aspect diagram, but be aware that strong winds on the upper mountain Sunday afternoon may create unusual loading patterns as well as load lee aspects much further downslope than usual. Large natural and human triggered wind slab avalanches will be possible on lee aspects near and above treeline.  </p>

<p>Backcountry travel is not recommended near and above treeline Sunday on Mt. Hood. Below treeline, choose conservative terrain such as lower angled slopes while watching for firmer wind transported snow down into the below treeline band during the afternoon.  </p>

                <p>We are going to keep the snow tap turned on for one more day with additional light to moderate snowfall Sunday night followed by a sharp cooling trend and light showers on Monday.</p>

<p>Moderate snow is expected for the central-east and southeast Cascades Sunday night and combined with a slight warming trend, this may cause a natural avalanche cycle in these zones overnight. Lighter snowfall is expected in the northeast Cascades with cooler temperatures.</p>

<p>Storm slab sensitivity may peak Sunday night particularly in the central-east and southeast Cascades, but may still be touchy Monday. While deeper storm slab instabilities should be healing, it is still possible to trigger a large storm slab avalanche in isolated areas closer to the Cascade crest.</p>

<p>Lingering wind slabs will be the primary avalanche hazard in the northeast zone near and above treeline. </p>

<p>Natural or human triggered small loose dry avalanches are possible in steeper terrain. Avoid terrain traps where a small but fast running small loose avalanche could have unintended consequences. </p>

<p>Continue to dig snowpits identifying and testing for PWLs in the snowpack, especially in areas further east of the crest with a shallower snowpack and on northerly aspects in the Washington Pass zone below the 1/17 crust. </p>

<p>New snow instabilities will need more time to settle out so make conservative terrain choices by choosing lower angled terrain and avoiding wind loaded slopes near and above treeline. </p>

Showers should end or become widely scattered Tuesday morning. Cold temperatures and decreasing winds are expected Tuesday. This should allow for slow settlement and stabilization of recent wind and storm slabs formed during the storm cycle since Friday. However, new fresh wind slabs may still be touchy Tuesday. </p>

<p>Storm slabs may still be sensitive on Tuesday, but likely confined to the most recent storm snow over the past day. While deeper storm slab instabilities should be stabilizing, it may still be possible to trigger a large storm slab avalanche in isolated areas. </p>

<p>The unconsolidated snow is deep, so being aware that loose dry avalanches triggered on steep slopes can entrain substantial snow.   </p>

<p>Instabilities within the deep new snow may need more time to settle out so make conservative terrain choices by choosing lower angled terrain and avoiding any wind loaded slopes, mainly near and above treeline. </p>

<p>Note that deep snow conditions now exist in most terrain. Travel with a partner and use good communication and keep your partner in view at all times. </p>

Plan on rapid warming Wednesday night and heavy rain or snow with higher snow levels through Thursday morning. This should cause an avalanche cycle in the Olympics and Cascades which should test the snowpack.</p>

<p><strong>Update: Snow and now heavy or very heavy rain has fallen since last night at Paradise, Crystal and Mt Baker. Water equivalents for these sites for the past 24 hours is in the 3-4 inch range with more expected until the front crosses the area. The forecast for the west slopes of the Cascades has been adjusted to an extreme avalanche danger for Thursday.</strong></p>

<p><strong>This means that large to very large loose wet or wet slab avalanches should be expected along the Cascade west slopes especially in areas that are receiving heavy rain such as Paradise, Crystal and Mt Baker. Small avalanches may step to deeper layers during the cycle.</strong></p>

<p><strong>These are dangerous conditions and all avalanche terrain should be avoided in this area.</strong></p>

<p>The cold front should cross the Cascades Thursday midday. This should cause a change to showers and lowering snow levels. The avalanche danger should begin to decrease following the cold front Thursday afternoon.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Saturday:</h2>
                <p>Light to moderate showers Friday night should taper off after midnight with only isolated light snow showers expected on Saturday. The same trend is expected for the moderate to occasionally strong W-SW winds forecast for Friday night with winds easing considerably on Saturday.</p>

<p>Strong winds Friday and Friday night will have built fresh wind slab on lee aspects mainly near and above treeline. Watch for new wind slab in the upper portion of the below treeline band. Easterly aspects will be highlighted in the elevation/aspect diagram but watch for firmer wind transported snow on a variety of aspects.   </p>

<p>Despite the cooling trend, new and shallow storm slab instabilities may be locally sensitive. Storm slab size will range from small to large in the Mt. Baker area where more snowfall is expected.  </p>

<p>For areas west of the Cascade crest including Mt. Baker, Crystal and Mt. Rainier, wet slabs will not be listed as they are very unlikely due to the cooling trend. However, for one more day avoid travel below unsupported slopes, especially below treeline, with the low likelihood/high consequence of large wet slab avalanches in mind. Wet slab releases are hard to predict and can happen a day or two after peak warming and rainfall.   </p>

<p>Older wind slabs should have mostly settled and stabilized the past couple days. Significant new wind slab is not expected Tuesday as southeast to southwest winds won't transport sun affected snow. But continue to watch for signs of wind deposited snow on north facing terrain features.</p>

<p>Recent cornices have become quite large and continued mild temperatures Monday will maintain the danger of failing cornices.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Wednesday:</h2>
                <p>Strong southwest flow aloft will carry a very moist frontal system to the Northwest on Wednesday. This will cause stormy wet weather along the Cascade west slopes on Wednesday with rain and high snow levels. The most rain should be seen in the northwest zone at Mt Baker with several inches expected but pretty heavy rain should seen elsewhere along the Cascade west slopes. Some freezing rain may be seen near the Cascade Passes and at low elevations east of the crest. See the NWAC Mountain Weather Forecast for details.</p>

<p>Wednesday will be a potentially dangerous day along the Cascade west slopes. Natural or triggered large or very large loose wet and wet slab avalanches are likely or very likely on Wednesday depending on how much rain there is, how it percolates into the snowpack and if avalanches entrain deeper layers.</p>

<p>Observations and tests for loose wet avalanches are more straightforward such as wet surface snow deeper than a few inches, rollerballs and natural loose wet avalanche actiivity.</p>

<p>But observations and tests for wet slab avalanches are more difficult since it is usually hard to know the effects of significant amounts of water percolating into the snowpack.</p>

<p>Travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended along the Cascade west slopes on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Storm slabs are expected to have stabilized by this time.</p>

<p>Cloudier weather should limit the potential for loose wet avalanches on Friday and this will not be indicated as an avalanche problem. Watch for wet surface snow deeper than a few inches if you find yourself on sun exposed slopes during any extended sun breaks.</p>

<p>Loose dry avalanches will also not be indicated as an avalanche problem. You can do tests for loose dry avalanches by pushing snow onto small safe test slopes.</p>

<p>Avoid areas along ridges where there may be a cornice and slopes below cornices, since cornices can fail at any time.</p>

                <p>A brief period of high pressure should build over the area Saturday. This will allow for clearing and plenty of sunshine Saturday. Winds should remain light with very cool temperatures. </p>

<p>Old hard slabs formed earlier in the week should continue to heal, isolated to specific terrain features, and very stubborn to human triggering Saturday.</p>

<p>Watch for any shallow fresh wind slabs that may have formed early Friday, 2/24 during moderate westerly winds above treeline. </p>

<p>More sunshine is expected Saturday than previously this week. Direct sunshine and some daytime warming should gradually increase the potential for loose wet avalanches Saturday, mainly confined to steep solar aspects during the warmest part of the day. Watch for wet surface snow deeper than a few inches if you find yourself on sun exposed slopes during any extended sun breaks.</p>

<p>Loose dry avalanches have been triggered this week, but will not be indicated as an avalanche problem. You can do tests for loose dry avalanches by pushing snow onto small safe test slopes.</p>

Fresh wind slab should mainly be found near and above treeline but may also form in the upper portion of the below treeline band.  Be aware that lower density snowfall received as the winds ease during the day on Sunday may obscure recently wind loaded slopes.  </p>

<p>Watch for loose dry avalanches on steeper slopes in non-wind affected terrain. Be especially wary of fast running loose dry avalanches near terrain traps. </p>

<p>Storm slabs will not be listed as a primary avalanche problem on Sunday but watch for shallow storm slabs particularly from Snoqualmie Pass and south if new storm layers form a cohesive slab above weaker snow in specific terrain on Sunday. </p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Thursday:</h2>
                <p>The next front will begin to move over the Northwest Thursday afternoon and night. This should mainly bring increasing moderate to heavy snow to the Northwest Cascades Thursday afternoon with less snow through the daylight hours along the rest of the Cascade west slopes. Increasing SW-W alpine winds should generally be seen in all areas on Thursday.</p>

<p>Existing wind slab should linger and possibly further build on NW-SE aspects along the Cascade west slopes on Thursday.  New wind slab is likely to build in the Northwest Cascades on NW-SE aspects Thursday afternoon due to the incoming front and a greater wind slab danger will be indicated for that area. Remember to watch for wind transported snow on other aspects as well in all areas.</p>

<p>Existing storm slab may also linger along the Cascade west slopes on Thursday.  New storm slab is likely to build in the Northwest Cascades Thursday afternoon due to the incoming front and a greater storm slab danger will be indicated for that area. Storm slab is generally found on more sheltered slopes that experience rapid snow accumulations for several or more hours.</p>

<p>Remember to change your plans if the weather deteriorates sooner than expected in any area.</p>

<p>The cornice accident at Washington Pass on Tuesday is a reminder to avoid ridges or mountain tops where there may be a cornice and avoid slopes below cornices.</p>

<p>Loose wet avalanches also won't be listed as an avalanche problem but it is March so watch for roller balls and loose wet snow deeper than a few inches in you are on solar slopes in sun breaks.</p>

<p>Further increasing alpine winds and snow with a further increasing avalanche danger should be seen in all areas Thursday night and Friday.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Sunday:</h2>
                <p>Light to moderate snow showers at cool temperatures are expected overnight and early Sunday before tapering through the day. Winds should be light, except light to moderate in the alpine.</p>

<p>Only light accumulations of new snow are expected and with cold temperatures and light winds this should not affect the current avalanche danger significantly. The avalanche danger should gradually decrease on Sunday. However, cold temperatures may help maintain older wind slab and isolated storm slab layers.</p>

<p>Heightened avalanche conditions are expected on specific terrain features, such as steep wind loaded slopes and steep unsupported slopes, or cross loaded features. Avalanche conditions are expected to gradually improve, however, evaluate snow and terrain carefully and avoid features or slopes of concern Sunday.</p>

<p>Recent moderate to strong S-SW winds will make wind slab most likely on northwest to southeast slopes, but keep an eye out on all aspects in areas of more complex terrain. Watch for firmer wind transported snow from Friday and possible deeper wind transported layers. Older wind slabs may be masked by shallow fresh snow.</p>

<p>Cornices won't be listed as an avalanche problem in this area, but avoid travel on ridges, where recent cornices may have formed and avoid slopes below cornices.</p>

This is a time to plan travel on lower angled terrain well away from avalanche paths or run out zones. Avoid large steep open slopes or terrain of consequence. Change your plans if weather and snow conditions are different than expected.</p>

<p>More than the usual zones are in this forecast due to the expected differences from south to north on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Alpine winds have recently been SW to W, with further mostly SW to W winds expected on Tuesday. Hence wind slab should be most likely on northwest to southeast aspects. But watch for firmer wind transported snow on other aspects especially in areas of complex terrain.</p>

<p>Most areas have experienced rapidly accumulating snowfall and temperature fluctuation the past couple days. Storm slab from this weather may not have stabilized. More areas of rapidly accumulating snowfall with fluctuating temperatures are expected on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Cornices won't be listed as an avalanche problem but avoid travel on ridges near where cornices may have formed and avoid steep slopes below cornices that may fail at any time.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Wednesday:</h2>
                <p>Strong southwest flow carried a front across the Northwest on Tuesday. This should bring another 5-10 in of snow to most of the Cascade east slopes by Wednesday morning with SW-W alpine winds and warming temperatures. Warming temperatures favor denser surface layers and the formation of wind and storm slab avalanches.</p>

<p>There has been a lot of snow the past few days and along the Cascade east slopes you may not be able to use the backcountry in your usual manner. Your usual slopes and routes may not be safe from avalanches. Plan to stay on low angle slopes away from avalanche terrain. There is more uncertainty than usual due to lack of backcountry field reports and the new snowfall. Avalanches may be larger and run farther than usual.</p>

<p>Wind slab should be watched for on all aspects but should be found mainly on NW to SE aspects due to recent SW to W winds. Watch for firmer wind transported snow on varied aspects especially in areas of complex terrain.</p>

<p>Most areas will have seen rapidly accumulating snowfall by Wednesday. Previous storm slab may not have stabilized. The warming trend will increase the likelihood of new storm slab layers.</p>

<p>The persistent slab problem has returned to the Northeast zone forecast due to recent avalanches and some reactive tests on the Valentine's Day crust in this area. We may have had enough snow for avalanches to step to or run on the Valentine's Day crust in other areas. Such avalanches would be large and very dangerous.</p>

<p>Cornices won't be listed as an avalanche problem but avoid travel on ridges near where cornices may have formed and avoid steep slopes below cornices that may fail at any time.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Thursday:</h2>
                <p>A weak low pressure system should produce 6-18 inches of snow for the west slopes of the Cascades Wednesday afternoon and night, with the most snow likely for Paradise and White Pass. A subtle warming trend Wednesday night may produce a spike in avalanche activity overnight. </p>

<p>However the main event will be the storm system forecast Thursday afternoon through Friday morning.  A low pressure system tracking north across Washington State will bring increasing precipitation first for the south and central Cascades Thursday afternoon and then to the north Cascades Thursday night. Less precipitation, warming, and wind is forecast for the north Cascades through the daylight hours than for areas further south. </p>

<p>There has been a lot of snow the past few days especially in the Mt. Baker area and you cannot use the backcountry in your usual manner. There is more uncertainty than usual due to lack of backcountry field reports and the heavy snowfall. Account for this uncertainty by choosing simple lower angled terrain. If the storm impacts the northwest Cascades faster than predicted Thursday afternoon, make sure you have exit routes that do not cross avalanche paths.</p>

<p>Deep wind slab should be watched for on all aspects but should be found mainly on NW to SE aspects due to recent SW to W winds. Watch for firmer wind transported snow on varied aspects especially in areas of complex terrain.</p>

<p>Cornices won't be listed as an avalanche problem but avoid travel on ridges near where cornices may have formed and avoid steep slopes below cornices that may fail at any time.</p>

<p>There has been enough snow lately that snow immersion suffocation accidents are possible. Travel with a partner and keep them in sight at all times.</p>

Cornices along ridges have become very large. </p>, '\n\n', <p>On Thursday, rainfall was beginning to saturate the upper snowpack with un-supportive wet snow allowing several feet of boot penetration by mid-day. </p>, '\n\n            ', <div class=""forecast-detailed"">
                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Friday:</h2>
                <p>Snow levels should peak around 8000 feet Thursday evening and be followed by a slow cool down with quickly diminishing shower activity on Friday. W-SW winds will stay very strong through Friday morning.</p>

<p>With a complex weather pattern afflicting the Cascades and Mt. Hood Thursday and Thursday night and stressing our deep storm snow received over the last week, travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended on Friday. Allow the recently stressed snowpack time to settle and avoid consequential terrain. Realize that very large avalanches are possible if initially small avalanches step down to deep and lingering storm instabilities or if a large natural trigger like a cornice collapse occurs. </p>

<p>Deep wind slab should be suspected on all aspects near and above treeline but most likely found on NW to SE aspects due to recent SW to W winds. Watch for firmer wind transported snow on varied aspects especially in areas of complex terrain.</p>

<p>Loose wet avalanches that begin small may become large by entraining deeper layers. Large wet slab avalanches will be possible in isolated areas due to the significant rainfall received Thursday and Thursday night.  </p>

<p>Cornices won't be listed as an avalanche problem but avoid travel on ridges near where cornices may have formed and avoid steep slopes below cornices that may fail at any time. Cornices have been reported as large and in charge in many areas. They will have likely been weakened during the recent storm cycle becoming more likely to fail. </p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Saturday:</h2>
                <p>Another front will cross the Northwest on Saturday. This will bring another day of increasing strong alpine winds and increasing rain or snow to the Olympics and Cascades. Snow levels should rise up to about 4000 feet in the northeast Cascades and perhaps about 5500 feet in the southeast Cascades.</p>

<p>Wind slab should be suspected mainly above treeline on all aspects but is most likely on NW to SE aspects due to recent SW to W winds. Watch for firmer wind transported snow on varied aspects especially in areas of complex terrain.</p>

<p>New sensitive storm slab is most likely above treeline in areas that receive more than a few inches of rapidly accumulating snowfall.</p>

<p>The persistent slab problem has returned to the Northeast zone due to recent avalanches and some reactive tests on the Valentine's Day or 2/17 crust. Avalanches stepping down to these depths would be large and very dangerous.</p>

<p>Loose wet avalanches won't be listed in the northeast zone due to a plethora of avalanche problems but are likely in all zones on steep slopes near or below treeline during rain showers. Loose wet avalanches along the east slopes of the Cascades that begin small may become large by entraining deeper layers.</p>

<p>Cornices won't be listed as an avalanche problem but avoid travel on ridges near where cornices may have formed and avoid steep slopes below cornices that may fail at any time. Cornices have been reported as large and in charge in many areas. They will have likely been weakened during the recent storm cycle becoming more likely to fail.</p>

<p>The snowpack may remain reactive and dangerous on Saturday and is only beginning the spring stabilizing process. Higher precipitation intensities could trigger avalanches. Avalanches may step down or entrain deeper layers and be large and dangerous especially if they reach the Valentine's Day crust layer.</p>

<p>Backcountry travel in avalanche terrain above treeline is not recommended on Saturday. Careful snowpack evaluation and cautious routefinding will be required in other areas.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Sunday:</h2>
                <p>At break between frontal systems should be seen at Mt Hood on Sunday.</p>

<p>Mother Nature is throwing a lot of avalanche problems at us right now so review the forecast to remind yourself of what to watch for if you are planning a trip into the backcountry.</p>

<p>New or previous wind slab should be suspected mainly on NW-SE aspects above treeline due to recent SW-W winds. But watch for firmer wind transported snow on all aspects especially in areas of complex terrain.</p>

<p>New sensitive storm slab is most likely above treeline in areas that receive more than a few inches of rapidly accumulating snowfall.</p>

<p>Avoid travel on ridges near where cornices will have been loaded and weakened by recent storms and avoid steep slopes below cornices that may fail at any time. Cornices have been reported as large and sensitive in several areas and have been involved in recent accidents and close calls.</p>

<p>Loose wet avalanches are most likely on solar slopes in the near and below treeline especially if you are in an area with sunshine or little cloud cover. Watch for surface wet snow deeper than a few inches, pinwheels and initial small releases that will get bigger the longer the sun heats the snowpack.</p>

<p>Dangerous avalanche conditions are expected Sunday. We only got a taste of the spring stabilizing process the past couple days. Avalanches may step down or entrain deeper layers and be large and dangerous especially if they reach the Valentine's Day crust layer.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Monday:</h2>
                <p>A front should sag slowly south over the Northwest on Monday. Waves of moisture moving along the front should cause a very wet day in the Olympics and Cascades. Periods of moderate to heavy rain or snow should be heaviest along the Cascade west slopes with rising snow levels.</p>

<p>Mother Nature will throw a lot of serious avalanche problems at us again on Monday. The exact outcome of the snow, rain and warmer temperatures is hard to predict but we have to expect multiple types of potentially large or very large avalanches.</p>

<p>Loose wet avalanches are very likely in areas of wet snow or rain.</p>

<p>Avoid areas on ridges in the Northeast zone where there are potential cornices and slopes below cornices. Cornices will be weakened and prone to failure on Monday due to loading by wet snow and rain and warm temperatures. Large cornices have been reported from many areas and have been involved in recent accidents and close calls.</p>

<p>New sensitive storm slab is most likely above treeline in areas that receive more than a few inches of rapidly accumulating snowfall.</p>

<p>New or previous wind slab should be suspected mainly on NW-SE aspects above treeline due to recent SW-W winds. But watch for firmer wind transported snow on all aspects especially in areas of complex terrain.</p>

<p>The persistent slab problem was returned to the Northeast zone due to recent avalanches and some reactive tests on the Valentine's Day or 2/17 crust. Avalanches stepping down to these depths would be large and very dangerous.</p>

<p>Very dangerous avalanche conditions are expected in the above treeline areas east of the crest on Monday and travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended in these areas. Careful snowpack evaluation and cautious routefinding will be required in other areas.</p>

                <p>The relatively high snow levels will continue with rain forecast below 7500-8500 feet through Tuesday morning at Mt. Hood.

<p>Loose wet avalanches are likely on steeper slopes with the additional rainfall. While most loose wet avalanches will be shallow, a few may gouge down to deeper layers and become more powerful than you expect. </p>

<p>Cornices will be weakened and prone to failure due to rain and mild temperatures. Very large cornices have been reported in many areas and have been involved in recent accidents and close calls. A cornice failure could trigger a large and destructive wet slab avalanche. </p>

<p>Wet slab avalanches are highly unpredictable and not necessarily tied to peak warming or rainfall. Glide cracks can indicate areas where wet slab avalanches are more likely to occur. Besides their destructive potential, wet slab avalanches often surprise backcountry travelers when they run further than expected. </p>

<p>If you manage to venture into the above treeline zone Tuesday, expect new or previous wind slab mainly on NW-SE aspects due to recent SW-W winds. Continue to watch for firmer wind transported snow on all aspects especially in areas of complex terrain.</p>

                <p>Gradual cooling is underway as of Wednesday afternoon as a cooler trough approaches. Light to moderate showers at further lowering snow levels are expected Wednesday night and early Thursday with moderate crest level winds.</p>

<p>Cool air should be over the area by Thursday with only scattered light showers expected as high pressure rebuilds over the area.</p>

<p>This weather will allow the previously wet snow pack to begin re-freezing and strengthening, causing an overall decreasing trend in the avalanche danger. </p>

<p>We have already experienced a region-wide avalanche cycle, such that the overall likelihood of wet snow avalanches has diminished. However, destructive wet slab avalanches are still being reported in isolated areas in the Cascades as of Wednesday. Realize that wet snow avalanches, specifically wet slab avalanches, are very hard to predict and demand an extra amount of caution when engaging with avalanche terrain.</p>

<p>The cooling trend through Thursday will lower the overall danger as surface snow begins to form a crust and liquid water continues to drain.  </p>

<p>With that said, there remains a possibility of further wet slab avalanches, especially on unsupported slopes with a rock face bed surface.  These types of avalanches are highly unpredictable and not necessarily tied to peak warming or rainfall. Besides their huge destructive potential, wet slab avalanches often surprise backcountry travelers when they run further than expected. Watch for evidence of large cracks forming in the snow due to glide, especially on terrain with rocky bed surfaces.</p>

<p>Cornices have been weakened and prone to failure due to rain and mild temperatures. Very large cornices have been reported in many areas and have been involved in recent accidents and close calls. A cornice failure could trigger a large and destructive wet slab avalanche.</p>

<p>If you manage to venture into the above treeline zone Thursday, expect new or previous wind slabs mainly on NW-SE aspects due to recent SW-W winds. Continue to watch for firmer wind transported snow on all aspects, especially in areas of complex terrain.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Friday:</h2>
                <p>A low pressure system is expected to form well to the SW of track towards the central Washington coast on Friday, before moving inland Friday night. This system should spread increasing light precipitation to Mt Hood Friday morning, before spreading to the remainder of the forecast area Friday afternoon, with rising snow levels. The peak in winds, snow levels and precipitation are expected Friday night into early Saturday morning.</p>

<p>At Mt Hood previous wind slab is most likely to linger on NW to SE aspects due to previous SW-W winds. But watch for firmer wind transported snow on other aspects especially in areas of complex terrain.</p>

<p>Small loose wet avalanche conditions are most likely to linger at lower elevations or to develop as rain moves in on Friday afternoon. Watch for surface wet snow deeper than a few inches, rollerballs or increasing small natural releases.</p>

<p>Although the likelihood of wet slab or glide avalanches has greatly decreased, continue to avoid unsupported slopes where you know there is a smooth underlying surface, or slopes with glide cracks.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Saturday:</h2>
                <p><strong>Saturday morning update: Rising snow levels following 6-12"" of new snow overnight will cause increasing avalanche danger for the central and northeast Cascades. Dangerous avalanche conditions are expected Saturday with increasing danger with elevation. ?The danger will highest closer to the Cascade crest and locally lower in areas further east such as Blewett Pass and Mission Ridge. </strong></p>

<p> low pressure system is tracking towards the central Washington coast from the SW, expected to move inland across the Olympics Friday night. This system should spread increasing precipitation, strong winds and rising snow levels, late Friday through early Saturday. The peak in winds, snow levels and precipitation are expected Friday night into early Saturday morning. Significant cooling, diminishing showers and winds are expected through the day Saturday.</p>

<p>Along the Cascade east slopes previous wind slab is most likely to linger on NW to SE aspects due to previous SW-W winds. But watch for firmer wind transported snow on other aspects, especially in areas of complex terrain.</p>

<p>The biggest factor affecting Saturday's avalanche forecast confidence will be how much precipitation is received overnight and to what elevation the rain/snow line reached.</p>

<p>New wind slabs are likely to have built on NW to SE aspects, mainly above treeline. But watch for firmer wind transported snow on other aspects, especially in areas of complex terrain.</p>

<p>At lower elevations, rain Friday night should leave a wet and slowly re-freezing snowpack with shallow new snow accumulation expected Saturday. Small loose wet avalanche conditions are most likely to persist at lower elevations, especially if the cooling is delayed early Saturday. Watch for surface wet snow deeper than a few inches, rollerballs or increasing small natural releases.</p>

<p>Although the likelihood of wet slab or glides avalanches has greatly decreased with the recent re-freeze, these avalanche problems may reemerge following the warm and wet weather Friday night. Continue to avoid unsupported slopes where you know there is a smooth underlying surface, or slopes with glide cracks.</p>

<p>It is always a good plan to travel well back from ridges, suspected of cornice formation, or on steep slopes below cornices.</p>

<p>Remember to re-evaluate or change plans if local conditions vary from forecast conditions.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Sunday:</h2>
                <p>Decreasing snow showers along with rapid cooling Saturday night through Sunday morning should transition to mostly sunny skies by Sunday afternoon. Freezing levels will be on the cool side Sunday but late March sunshine will help bump up temperatures to near or above freezing at lower and mid-elevations. Winds are forecast to be fairly light on Sunday.</p>

<p>The avalanche danger should decrease Sunday as a wet snowpack refreezes.</p>

<p>Fresh but shallow wind slabs have likely built on NW to SE aspects, mainly above treeline. Watch for firmer wind transported snow on other aspects, especially in areas of complex terrain. All aspects will be listed until more information is received on recent general loading patterns. </p>

<p>Generally small loose wet avalanches are likely at lower elevations and on solar slopes. Watch for surface wet snow deeper than a few inches, rollerballs or increasing small natural releases.</p>

<p>Although the likelihood of wet slab or glides avalanches has greatly decreased with the cooling trend, these avalanche problems may still occur 24 to 48 hours following a heavy rain event. Continue to avoid unsupported slopes, especially where you know there is a smooth underlying surface or slopes with glide cracks.</p>

<p>New snow accumulated with a cooling trend and diminishing winds, but small storm slabs may remain in isolated areas on Sunday. </p>

<p>It is always a good plan to travel well back from ridges,<a href=""http://www.nwac.us/blog/2017/03/14/Cornices/""> suspected of cornice formation</a>, or on steep slopes below cornices.</p>

                <p>Increasing cloud cover should quickly spread from south to north over the Cascades on Monday. Precipitation may develop for the southern Washington Cascades Monday afternoon but hold off until the evening for areas further north. Offshore gradients will create locally breezy east winds near the Cascade Passes.  </p>

<p>The avalanche danger should decrease further on Monday. Light to locally moderate E-SE winds may distribute shallow amounts of recent snow onto westerly aspects near and above treeline. Older wind slab may linger on NW to SE aspects. Watch for firmer wind transported snow on all aspects, especially in areas of complex terrain. </p>

<p>Increasing clouds should lower the likelihood of small loose wet slides Monday, however the avalanche danger will be maintained at Moderate Below Treeline for the northwest Cascades including Mt. Baker due to the potential to receive more solar radiation than areas further south. Watch for surface wet snow deeper than a few inches, rollerballs or increasing small natural releases. Avoid areas with terrain traps where a small loose wet avalanche could have unintended consequences. </p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Wednesday:</h2>
                <p>Additional showers, mostly light to occasionally moderate, should persist Tuesday night through Wednesday. Significant cooling is expected through the day Wednesday.</p>

<p>The cooling Wednesday should allow for an overall decreasing danger. Previous moist to wet shallow surface snow should begin re-freezing and strengthening.</p>

<p>Only shallow snow from a few inches up to about 8-10 inches overlies the strong rain crust from 3/18 in most areas, mostly depending upon elevation and recent precipitation amounts.</p>

<p>Moderate winds and showers at lowering snow levels should build some shallow fresh wind slabs at higher terrain along ridges, mainly on NW-NE-E facing terrain. Watch for firmer wind transported snow on all aspects, especially in areas of complex terrain. </p>

<p>At lower elevations, gradually re-freezing surface snow will form a new strengthening crust by later Wednesday. </p>

<p>It is always a good plan to travel well back from ridges, <a href=""http://www.nwac.us/blog/2017/03/14/Cornices/"">suspected of cornice formation</a>, or on steep slopes below cornices.</p>

<p>Additionally, we have seen large cornice-fall avalanches that could trigger potentially very large wind-slabs formed during the last storm cycle or as new snow is added.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Thursday:</h2>
                <p>A break between weather systems should be seen on Thursday. Sun is most likely in the Olympics, the south Cascades and east of the crest but watch for solar effects in all areas.</p>

<p>Recent winds have been mostly S-SW so firmer wind slab should be found mainly on NW-SE slopes. But there have been winds from other directions lately such as local east winds on Monday so watch for firmer wind transported snow on all aspects, especially in areas of complex terrain.</p>

<p>Watch for solar effects in all areas especially in areas where there has been more than a few inches of snowfall the past couple days. Solar effects should make loose wet avalanches possible mainly on solar slopes in all the terrain bands but keep an eye out on all aspects. Watch for surface wet snow deeper than a few inches, pinwheels and increasing natural releases.</p>

<p>You need to avoid avoid areas on ridges where there may be a cornice and slopes below cornices! Natural cornice releases and resulting slab avalanches are unpredictable and as seen above in the special note cornices have triggered major slab avalanches lately. This avalanche in the special note above narrowly missed multiple parties and easily could have been a major avalanche accident!</p>

<p>See a blog post regarding cornices <a href=""http://www.nwac.us/blog/2017/03/14/Cornices/"">here</a>.</p>

<p> Although not listed as an avalanche problem watch for storm slab if you are in an area that has had more than a few inches of rapidly accumulating snowfall.</p>

<p>Increasing alpine winds, increasing clouds, and increasing rain or snow should be seen Thursday evening as the next front begins to move into the Northwest.</p>

                <p>A frontal system will slowly move across the Cascades Thursday night with modest amounts of new snow expected above 5500 feet on Mt. Hood area. Skies should remain cloudy on Friday with light to moderate showers and additional snow accumulations near and above treeline throughout the day. Snow levels should remain fairly consisent in the 5000-5500 ft range on Friday.  </p>

<p>There should be just enough new snow and wind to elevate storm related hazards on Friday and create locally dangerous conditions primarily near and above treeline.</p>

<p>Recent winds have been mostly S-SW so firmer wind slab should be found mainly on NW-SE slopes. But there have been winds from other directions lately such as local east winds on Monday so watch for firmer wind transported snow on all aspects, especially in areas of complex terrain.</p>

<p>New storm snow is expected to bond well to the existing snow surface Thursday night but storm slab may still become locally sensitive in areas that receive rapid accumulation Thursday night or Friday.  </p>

<p>Loose wet avalanches won't make the cut to be listed as an avalanche problem but are still possible in the below treeline band. Watch for surface wet snow deeper than a few inches, pinwheels and increasing natural releases. Avoid steeper slopes with terrain traps where small loose wet avalanches could have unintended consequences. </p>

<p>Make sure to avoid areas on ridges where there may be a cornice and slopes below cornices! Natural cornice releases and resulting slab avalanches are unpredictable. See a blog post regarding cornices <a href=""http://www.nwac.us/blog/2017/03/14/Cornices/"">here</a>.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Saturday:</h2>
                <p>Showers should decrease late Saturday morning through mid-day and become light and scattered in the afternoon. Sunbreaks are possible in the afternoon. The air mass will be cooler, but it's spring-time and solar effects should push temperatures near to above freezing at lower and mid-elevations in the afternoon.  </p>

<p>We continue to load and stress our snowpack. Don't push it in consequential avalanche terrain - keep it simple and conservative and wait for this pattern to break. Recent storm/wind slab concerns up high and loose wet potential on steeper solar aspects/lower elevations will challenge us to manage terrain safely. Cornices have recently proven dangerous and unpredictable and capable of triggering very large avalanches.   </p>

<p>Recent winds have been mostly S-SW, so firmer wind slab should be found mainly on NW-SE slopes near and above treeline. Avoid recently wind loaded slopes as human triggered avalanches are considered likely. There is the potential for very large wind slab avalanches on lee slopes above treeline due to the persistent loading pattern. </p>

<p>New storm snow is expected to bond well due to a cooling trend Friday night but storm slab may still become locally sensitive in areas that receive rapid accumulations Friday night or Saturday morning. </p>

<p>Subtle daytime warming and/or potential sunbreaks Saturday afternoon will increase the potential for loose wet avalanches on steeper solar slopes and at lower elevations. Loose wet avalanches won't be listed as an avalanche problem, but watch for surface wet snow deeper than a few inches, pinwheels and increasing natural releases. Avoid steeper slopes with terrain traps where even small loose wet avalanches could have unintended consequences. </p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Tuesday:</h2>
                <p>Warm front moisture should begin moving into the Northwest on Tuesday especially to the Olympics and north to central Cascades. But rain or snow and warming should also begin to increase over the south Cascades on Tuesday. The avalanche danger levels will be a moving target as they rise on Tuesday especially in the north to central Cascades.</p>

<p>Recent SW alpine winds have built wind slab on mainly NW-SE slopes. But watch for firmer wind transported snow that indicates wind slab on all aspects in areas of more complex terrain.</p>

<p>Loose wet avalanches should become possible in the near and below treeline at Mt Hood mainly due to light rain, solar effects and warming. Watch for wet surface snow deeper than a few inches, pinwheels or initial but growing natural releases.</p>

<p>Recent cornices are very large. Make sure to avoid areas on ridges where there may be an overhanging cornice as well as travel on steep slopes below cornices! Natural cornice releases and resulting slab avalanches are unpredictable. See a blog post regarding cornices <a href=""http://www.nwac.us/blog/2017/03/14/Cornices/"">here</a>.</p>

<p>You will need to keep a sharper than usual eye on weather conditions if you take a trip into the backcountry on Tuesday. Be prepared to ratchet back your plans if winds become stronger and snow or rain becomes heavier than you expect and you see signs of instability such as cracking of new snow layers or loose wet avalanches before Tuesday night.</p>

<p>The avalanche danger should continue to significantly increase on Tuesday night.</p>

                <p>A warm front is moving over the Northwest mainly over the Washington Cascades on Tuesday. However a second frontal system will move over the Northwest Tuesday night and Wednesday. The second system will cause periods of moderate to heavy rain or snow with further gradually rising snow levels Tuesday night and Wednesday including at Mt Hood.</p>

<p>An avalanche cycle is expected by Tuesday night and should last into Wednesday. Snow that has accumulated since the mid-March avalanche cycle may be involved or entrained in avalanches.</p>

<p>SW alpine winds are likely to begin to build new wind slab on mainly N-SE slopes on Tuesday night and Wednesday. Alpine winds have been predominately from the SW-WSW the pasts few days with some SE winds seen at the top of Crystal. Hence NW to SE slopes will be indicated.</p>

<p>Loose wet avalanches will be likely in the near treeline and below treeline where there is significant rain and warming.</p>

<p>Although they won't be listed as avalanche problems, new storm slab is very likely at higher elevations and wet slab avalanches are possible at lower elevations.</p>

<p>Very dangerous avalanche conditions are expected on Wednesday and travel in avalanche terrain is not recommended in this area.</p>

In the last 5 days ending Monday morning NWAC stations near and west of the Cascade crest have picked up 1.5-4 ft of snow with the most at Mt. Baker and above the Pass levels.</p>, '\n\n', <p>A strong low pressure system brought rising snow levels and locally heavy precipitation Tuesday night through Wednesday along the west slopes of the Cascades. Most ski areas and DOT programs checked in reporting natural and explosive controlled avalanches in their area of responsibility. The most snow was received at Mt. Baker (2 feet) and Paradise (14 inches) with more moderate amounts elsewhere before changing to rain on Wednesday. </p>, '\n\n', <p><strong>Recent Observations</strong></p>, '\n\n', <p><strong>North</strong></p>, '\n\n', <p>On Wednesday Mt. Baker pro-patrol reported widespread storm slab and loose wet avalanches below 4500 feet during morning control work. 1 large natural avalanche was observed off Shuskan Arm. Start zones above 5000' were stubborn to trigger during early morning control work but likely became more sensitive as warming pushed the snow-line higher during the day. </p>, '\n\n', <p><strong>Central</strong></p>, '\n\n', <p>On Wednesday Alpental pro-patrol reported widespread natural and explosive triggered storm slab avalanches late morning. Loose wet avalanches on the lower half of the mountain were beginning to entrain deeper layers. Snoqualmie DOT reported large natural avalanches (up to size D2.5) running in start zones above 4500 feet late Wednesday morning. Stevens Pass DOT reported large slides during control work Tuesday night with avalanches gouging down to deeper layers. </p>, '\n\n', <p><strong>South</strong></p>, '\n\n', <p>Crystal pro-patrol reported sensitive 4-8"" storm slab on the upper half of the mountain Wednesday morning. A widespread but shallow natural loose wet cycle was observed in the surrounding backcountry later in the day with continued warming. </p>, '\n\n            ', <div class=""forecast-detailed"">
                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Thursday:</h2>
                <p>Fresh storm and wind slab formed Wednesday night should generally be shallow and found near and above treeline. Due to the cooling trend, only wind slab will be listed in the avalanche problem set and emphasized above treeline. W-SW winds should have primarily built fresh wind slab on NW-SE aspects.</p>

<p>The danger will be rated higher in the Mt. Baker area where once again, more snow is expected with the cooling trend Wednesday afternoon and night. As well as new snow hazards, snow levels were regionally lower in the northwest zone during this event, continuing the low probability/high consequence potential for very large avalanches above treeline and large wet snow avalanches below treeline. </p>

<p>Despite the cooler snow levels forecast for Thursday, if previously wet surface snow has not refrozen, be suspicious of loose wet avalanches that may begin small but entrain older snow and become dangerous and difficult to manage. Sunbreaks Thursday afternoon will likely activate loose wet slides on solar slopes. Stay off steeper slopes with terrain traps. Wet slab avalanches won't be listed but are possible in isolated locations at lower elevations that received ample rainfall on Wednesday. Moderate avalanche danger allows for large avalanches in isolated areas.</p>

<p>Recent cornices are very large. Natural cornice releases and resulting slab avalanches are dangerous and unpredictable. Give cornices a wide berth if traveling along ridge-lines and avoid slopes directly below large cornices.

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Friday:</h2>
                <p>High pressure is expected to rebuild over the area Thursday night through Friday. This will cause clearing overnight and allow for wet surface snow to begin refreezing and strengthening.</p>

<p>Partly to mostly sunny conditions Friday and warming temperatures should cause a gradual increase in danger from wet snow avalanches, especially on slopes receiving direct sun and during the warmest part of the day.</p>

<p>Recent shallow wind slabs should continue to settle and stabilize where formed on lee slopes, mainly above treeline and on NW-SE aspects.</p>

<p>The danger will be rated higher in the Mt Hood area than adjacent Cascade zones as winds have been significantly stronger, helping to maintain more widespread and potentially larger winds slabs above treeline. </p>

<p>The expected clearing and cooling overnight Thursday should cause a strengthening surface crust by Friday. However, if previously wet surface snow has not refrozen, be suspicious of loose wet avalanches that may begin small but entrain older snow and become dangerous and difficult to manage. Pay particular attention to steep solar facing slopes above terrain traps such as trees, cliffs or gullies where being caught and carried, even in a small slide, could prove consequential.</p>

<p>Recent cornices are very large. Natural cornice releases and resulting slab avalanches are dangerous and unpredictable. Give cornices a wide berth if traveling along ridge-lines and avoid slopes directly below large cornices.

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Monday:</h2>
                <p>Light winds and sunny weather should be seen on Monday with moderately warmer temperatures.</p>

<p>Sunshine will melt and possibly cause loose wet snow avalanches on steep solar slopes. Avoid steep sun exposed terrain if you see wet snow deeper than a few inches and initial rollerballs or small loose wet avalanches that can indicate an increasing loose wet avalanche danger.</p>

<p>Past wind slabs should have mostly stabilized where formed on lee slopes, mainly above treeline and on NW-SE aspects, but will remain listed as an avalanche problem in the Northeast zone for higher terrain that received heavy storm snow Wednesday.</p>

<p>Recent cornices are very large. Natural cornice releases and resulting slab avalanches are dangerous and unpredictable. Give cornices a wide berth if traveling along ridge-lines and avoid slopes below large cornices.

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Wednesday:</h2>
                <p>Heads up because winter isn't done yet and the quiet weather and snowpack seen the past couple days is going to see significant snow and rain depending on location on Wednesday!</p>

<p>A front will stall over the Northwest on Wednesday with a series of waves moving south to north along the front. This should cause periods of moderate to heavy rain or snow on the Washington volcanoes especially Mt Baker with light to moderate rain or snow in most other areas. Precipitation should fall as snow in the above treeline and perhaps down into the near treeline zones.</p>

<p>New storm slab should build in the above and perhaps down into the near treeline in most areas and will be deepest where there is the most new, rapidly accumulating new snowfall. New storm slab should be very touchy especially if there is a daytime warning trend.</p>

<p>Loose wet avalanches should be seen in most areas in the near and below treeline. Watch for wet surface snow deeper than a few inches, pinwheels and initial natural releases that indicate an increasing loose wet avalanche danger.</p>

<p>Recent cornices are very large and will get new loads on Wednesday. Natural cornice releases and resulting slab avalanches are dangerous and unpredictable. Give cornices a wide berth if traveling along ridge-lines and avoid slopes below large cornices. See a blog post regarding cornices <a href=""http://www.nwac.us/blog/2017/03/14/Cornices/"">here</a>.</p>

<p>New wind slabs won't be added to the lengthy list of avalanche problems on Wednesday but should also build in the above and perhaps down into the near treeline in most areas and will be deepest where there is the most new snowfall. New wind slab should also be very touchy especially if there is a daytime warning trend.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Thursday:</h2>
                <p>A stalled frontal boundary oriented north-south and to the west of the Cascades will finally lift to the northeast and out of the area Thursday. After a period of light to moderate rain and snow through late morning or mid-day, post-frontal showers, moderate at times in the northeast Cascades, will follow in the afternoon. More sunshine should mix in for the central-east and southeast Cascades in the afternoon. </p>

<p>Loose wet avalanches should be seen in all areas in the near and below treeline bands or on solar aspects during periods of extended sunshine. Watch for wet surface snow deeper than a few inches, pinwheels and initial natural releases that indicate an increasing loose wet avalanche danger.</p>

<p>New storm and wind slab problems should generally be shallow and primarily found near and above treeline. Treat recently wind loaded slopes with caution with fresh wind slab most likely on NW-SE aspects above treeline.  </p>

<p>Recent cornices are very large and have likely been weakened during this most recent storm cycle. Natural cornice releases and resulting slab avalanches are dangerous and unpredictable. Give cornices a wide berth if traveling along ridge-lines and avoid slopes below large cornices.

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Friday:</h2>
                <p>Warm frontal moisture will spread northward and move over the Cascades late Thursday night through early Friday morning with snow levels 5500-6500 ft and increasing E-SE winds affecting the Cascade Passes and higher terrain of the southwest Cascades. After a brief lull in the precipitation Friday morning, showers should begin mid-day and increase in the afternoon, becoming particularly heavy in the Mt. Baker area. S-SW winds will increase and should become strong and gusty by mid-day with snow levels falling to 4000-5000 ft in the afternoon.  </p>

<p>The avalanche danger will increase with elevation on Friday, creating dangerous avalanche conditions above treeline. New wind and storm slab problems will initially be found above treeline, however these problems should creep into the near tree-line elevation band by the end of the day in the central-west and southwest Cascades. The avalanche danger will be a notch lower in the Cascade Passes where less precipitation is expected.  </p>

<p>Travel above treeline is generally not recommended Friday. Southerly winds should primarily load W-N-E aspects, but very strong winds will cross-load slopes and create unusual loading patterns. Unstable storm slabs should develop in wind sheltered areas during periods of intense snowfall accumulation but only wind slab will be listed in the avalanche problem set.  A mix of wind and storm slab and loose wet concerns should be seen near treeline. </p>

<p>Loose wet avalanches are most likely below treeline. Watch for wet surface snow deeper than a few inches, pinwheels and initial natural releases that indicate an increasing loose wet avalanche danger. Be wary of steep slopes with terrain traps such as cliffs or if heavily treed, where even a small loose wet avalanche could have big consequences. </p>

<p>Recent cornices are very large and have likely been weakened during this most recent storm cycle. Natural cornice releases and resulting slab avalanches are dangerous and unpredictable. Give cornices a wide berth if traveling along ridge-lines and avoid slopes below large cornices.

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Sunday:</h2>
                <p>A break in storms is expected Sunday, allowing for sunshine and gradual warming. Light winds and sunshine should allow for recent storm snow to quickly become wet and weak, especially on steep slopes facing the sun during the late morning and afternoon. Loose wet avalanches should become increasingly likely in this terrain.</p>

<p>Watch for wet surface snow deeper than a few inches, pinwheels and initial natural releases that indicate an increasing loose wet avalanche danger. Be wary of steep slopes with terrain traps such as cliffs or if heavily treed, where even a small loose wet avalanche could have big consequences. Initial small loose wet avalanches may entrain significant wet snow and become dangerous quickly.</p>

<p>Recent potentially deep wind slabs should persist on various aspects above treeline due to the strong and shifting recent winds. Expect wind slab formation in potentially unusual locations, possibly well below ridges and to lower elevations near treeline.</p>

<p>Recent cornices are very large and have likely been weakened during this most recent storm cycle. Natural cornice releases and resulting slab avalanches are dangerous and unpredictable. Give cornices a wide berth if traveling along ridge-lines and avoid slopes below large cornices. See a blog post regarding cornices <a href=""http://www.nwac.us/blog/2017/03/14/Cornices/"">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Other avalanche problems not listed that may be encountered on Sunday include:</strong></p>

<p>Storm slab in more sheltered areas above treeline that experienced rapidly accumulating snowfall for more than a few hours.</p>

<p>Remember that solar effects can rapidly increase the touchiness of various types of avalanches at this time of year, loose-wet, cornices, glide and wind slab to name a few.</p>

Recent storm snow ranged from about 1 foot near treeline to about 2 feet above treeline. Recent wind slabs were noted as well as some fresh wind transported snow on many cross loaded features. Storm snow remained cold and dry on steeper shaded terrain at higher elevations. Wind slabs appeared to require a bit more settling time before venturing into steeper committed terrain.  Solar affects caused many natural small loose wet avalanches on steep solar slopes.</p>, '\n\n', <p><strong>Central</strong></p>, '\n\n', <p>The Alpental pro-patrol in a pit on the upper mountain reported alternating layers of stable crusts and wet snow in the upper snow pack on Friday. Below about 3500 feet, the snowpack was characterized by deep layers of large grains of wet snow.</p>, '\n\n', <p>A report via the NWAC Observations page for Friday indicated easily triggered, loose wet avalanches on Tonga Ridge west of Stevens Pass on Friday.</p>, '\n\n', <p>NWAC's Jermey Allyn was in the Alpental Valley, Sunday 4/9. Recent storm snow of about 6-8 inches was hanging in there on shaded terrain, over a very strong crust. On all but the steep shaded terrain at high elevations, shallow surface snow became wet and cohesive by midday as solar affects took hold. There was no evidence of wind slabs in this terrain, but no observations were made in true above treeline zones. Less storm snow and lighter winds have been the rule in the passes, however, so wind slabs are less likely in these zones. </p>, '\n\n', <p><strong>South</strong></p>, '\n\n', <p>NWAC's Matt Schonwald was in the Cement Basin area near Crystal Mountain on Sunday. North slopes had about 25-30 cm of F snow well bonded to an underlying crust, with shallower recent snow on other aspects.

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Tuesday:</h2>
                <p>A relative break between systems should be seen most of Tuesday. Clouds should increase and SE winds should begin to pick up mainly in the south Cascades as the next system approaches from the south in the afternoon. Rain or snow from this system should spread north over the Olympics and Cascades on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>Watch for recent and new wind slab mainly on NW-SE slopes above treeline. Keep an eye out for firmer wind transported snow that is a sign of wind slab.</p>

<p>The sun will be out or there will at least be solar effects on Tuesday and loose wet avalanches will be emphasized on solar slopes. But watch for surface wet snow deeper than few inches on all aspects. Initial rollerballs or small natural releases signal a developing loose wet avalanche danger. Initial small loose wet slides may entrain snow in steeper sun exposed terrain and cause large loose wet avalanches.</p>

<p>Recent cornices are very large and resulting slab avalanches are dangerous and unpredictable. Five people were tragically killed by a cornice release in BC on Saturday. Give cornices a wide berth if traveling along ridge-lines and avoid slopes below large cornices.

Recent storm snow ranged from about 1 ft near treeline to about 2 ft above treeline. Recent wind slabs were noted as well as some fresh wind transported snow on many cross loaded features. Storm snow remained cold and dry on steeper shaded terrain at higher elevations. Wind slabs appeared to require a bit more settling time before venturing into steeper committed terrain. Solar affects caused many natural small loose wet avalanches on steep solar slopes.</p>, '\n\n', <p>Lee and Jeremy Allyn were in the Mt Baker backcountry Tuesday, 4/11. Storm snow in non-wind affected terrain ranged from 8-12 inches and on steeper and shaded slopes provided good ski conditions. The winds were strong enough Tuesday above treeline to actively transport recent storm snow and continue to build fresh wind slab on lee terrain. Cornices were once again observed to be very large with at least 5 large cornice failures noted, likely releasing in the past day or two. These cornices pulled out D2 sized slabs on the slopes below. </p>, '\n\n', <p>Mt. Baker pro-patrol reported one natural wind slab off of Mt. Herman on Thursday. In area the new snow was not reactive to ski cuts at any elevation or aspect.

Fresh wind transported snow was observed above treeline outside the ski area. </p>, '\n\n', <p><strong>Central</strong></p>, '\n\n', <p>NWAC's Jermey Allyn was in the Alpental Valley, Sunday 4/9. Recent storm snow of about 6-8 inches was hanging in there on shaded terrain, over a very strong crust. On all but the steep shaded terrain at high elevations, shallow surface snow became wet and cohesive by midday as solar affects took hold. There was no evidence of wind slab in this terrain, but no observations were made in true above treeline zones.</p>, '\n\n', <p><strong>South</strong></p>, '\n\n', <p>NWAC's Matt Schonwald was in the Cement Basin area near Crystal Mountain on Sunday 4/9. North slopes had about 25-30 cm of Fist hardness snow well bonded to an underlying crust, with shallower recent snow on other aspects. Warming was helping settle recent snow, but was creating loose wet surface snow on West facing slopes.</p>, '\n\n', <p>WSDOT Chinook Pass crews checked in Wednesday and Thursday.  On Wednesday, shallow loose wet avalanches were sensitive to ski cuts below 5000' feet and running well. On Thursday, cooler temperatures helped limit the loose wet potential to below 4800' on solar aspects. Isolated pockets of wind slab could be found on lee slopes below ridges. About 14-18"" on storm snow sat above the most recent crust in non-sun/wind affected terrain. </p>, '\n\n            ', <div class=""forecast-detailed"">
                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Friday:</h2>
                <p>A cool upper trough will sit over the Pacific Northwest on Friday with shower activity increasing in the afternoon and evening. Sunbreaks are most likely during the late morning through mid-day before convective clouds build in the afternoon. The Mt. Baker area will maintain the Considerable rating above treeline due to ongoing wind transport and the potential for larger wind slab in this zone/elevation band.  </p>

<p>Watch for firmer wind transported snow, mainly on NW-SE slopes and above treeline on Friday. Fresh wind slab may have locally bonded poorly to graupel layers received Thursday. </p>

<p>After a cool night Thursday, snow levels will remain low on Friday. This should generally restrict the loose wet potential to the shallow amounts of new snow found on steeper solar aspects near and below treeline. This time of year even brief sunbreaks combined with subtle daytime warming can quickly activate loose wet avalanches. </p>

<p>Recent cornices are very large and resulting slab avalanches are dangerous and unpredictable. There have been numerous recent cornice failures with some being very large in the Washington Cascades. Five people were tragically <a href=""http://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/rescue-crews-respond-after-five-hikers-missing-near-lions-bay"">killed by a cornice release</a> in British Columbia on Saturday.

                <p>The cool upper level trough that's been plaguing the Pacific Northwest for several days should finally begin to loosen it's grip on the area Saturday. Clearing is expected in the Mt. Hood area Saturday afternoon.

<p>Afternoon sunshine will increase the loose wet potential on steeper solar aspects Saturday. Initially shallow loose wet avalanches could entrain deeper layers and become large in specific locations. Be especially wary of the loose wet avalanche potential near terrain traps. </p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Sunday:</h2>
                <p>Sunny, warmer weather with mostly S-SE-E crest level winds should be seen on Sunday.</p>

<p>A central question will be the extent loose wet avalanches on Sunday. Surface crusts from over night cooling should break fairly fast on Sunday and sunny weather can quickly activate loose wet avalanches. Loose wet avalanches will be indicated on all aspects but will be most likely on solar slopes. Watch for wet surface snow deeper than a few inches and initial small loose wet avalanches that indicate an increasing danger. Remember that even slow moving loose wet avalanches are powerful and you don't want to get caught in one especially above a terrain trap. Even small loose wet avalanches can have serious consequences.</p>

<p>Recent cornices are very large and resulting slab avalanches are dangerous and unpredictable. There have been numerous recent cornice failures with some being very large in the Washington Cascades. Five people were tragically <a href=""http://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/rescue-crews-respond-after-five-hikers-missing-near-lions-bay"">killed by a cornice release</a> in British Columbia on Saturday. Give cornices a wide berth if traveling along ridge-lines and avoid slopes below cornices. Many current back country routes are exposed to cornices; don't linger below one. See a blog post regarding cornices <a href=""http://www.nwac.us/blog/2017/03/14/Cornices/"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Warmer daytime temperatures are probably helping stabilize recently formed wind slab. Wind slab is mostly likely to linger on NW-SE slopes and will probably be stubborn to release by Sunday. Watch for firmer wind transported snow that indicates the presence of wind slab. </p>

Over the last few days, Mt. Hood stations have picked up 1 - 1.5 inches of water equivalent (WE). Much or all of this has fallen as snow above 5500-6000 feet. Moderate W-SW transport winds have occurred near and above treeline over this stretch as well. Natural loose wet avalanches have likely occurred throughout the week as the snow-line has oscillated or on solar aspects at lower elevations during sunbreaks. </p>, '\n\n', <p><strong>Recent observations</strong></p>, '\n\n', <p>None</p>, '\n\n            ', <div class=""forecast-detailed"">
                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Friday:</h2>
                <p>After a cool start, strong late April sunshine and rising freezing levels will quickly increase the loose wet hazard on all solar aspects. If the alpine winds out of the E-SE and high clouds increase in the afternoon as forecast, the greatest loose wet hazard above treeline will likely peak late morning through early afternoon. Fresh snow near and above tree-line will quickly activate with a natural shed cycle likely on steeper solar slopes. Loose wet avalanches at lower elevation may be less likely to initiate naturally, but if skier triggered, could entrain older snow layers and become large in specific areas. Keep this in mind around terrain traps. </p>

<p>Winds have transported recent snowfall over the past week onto lee slopes, with the most snowfall and transport occurring above treeline. Be suspicious of steeper wind loaded slopes below ridges. Expect the wind slab hazard to increase quickly with elevation. </p>

<p>Cornices are still large so give them a wide safety margin. Natural cornice releases and resulting slab avalanches are dangerous and unpredictable. Give cornices a wide berth if traveling along ridge-lines and avoid slopes below large cornices. See a blog post regarding cornices <a href=""http://www.nwac.us/blog/2017/03/14/Cornices/"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Avoid unsupported slopes with overhanging blocks of snow and smooth rock underneath. Glide avalanches can release at any time, not just during the heat of the day, and are by definition difficult to predict and manage. </p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Saturday:</h2>
                <p>Friday night should be mild with increasing mid and high clouds, likely preventing a solid refreeze tonight in many areas and elevations. A relatively weak frontal system will lift over the area from south to north beginning Saturday morning through mid-day Saturday and should be followed by light and scattered post-frontal showers in the Mt. Hood area. Light rain should generally be seen below 5500 feet. </p>

<p>Older wind slab formed earlier in the week should be unlikely to trigger on Saturday, but still treat steeper wind loaded slopes above treeline with caution.</p>

<p>Potential afternoon sunbreaks in the Mt. Hood area would help activate loose wet avalanches on solar aspects with fresh snow mainly near and above treeline. Loose wet avalanches at lower elevations should be less likely to initiate naturally, but if skier triggered, could entrain older snow layers and become large in specific areas. Keep this in mind around terrain traps. </p>

<p>Cornices are still large so give them a wide safety margin. Natural cornice releases and resulting slab avalanches are dangerous and unpredictable. Give cornices a wide berth if traveling along ridge-lines and avoid slopes below large cornices. See a blog post regarding cornices <a href=""http://www.nwac.us/blog/2017/03/14/Cornices/"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Avoid unsupported slopes with overhanging blocks of snow and smooth rock underneath. Glide avalanches can release at any time, not just during the heat of the day, and are by definition difficult to predict and manage. </p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Friday:</h2>
                <p>Fair weather with a modest rise in cool temperatures and low snow levels should be seen on Friday.</p>

<p>Small to very large loose wet avalanches are likely on solar slopes above treeline where recent snow will be less consolidated. Increasing spring sun can quickly melt night time surface crusts and rapidly activate loose wet snow and result in a dramatic increase in avalanche danger. Watch for surface wet snow deeper than a few inches, pinwheels and initial small loose wet avalanches that indicate an increasing loose wet avalanche danger.</p>

<p>New or recent wind slab will be most likely near and above treeline on lee aspects. NWAC stations at Mt Hood have had moderate to west winds on Wednesday and Thursday. So wind slab is most likely on NW to SE aspects but watch for firmer wind transported snow that is a sign of wind slab on other aspects in areas of varied terrain.</p>

<p>Cornices are still large so give them a wide safety margin. Natural cornice releases and resulting slab avalanches are dangerous and unpredictable. Give potential cornices a wide berth if traveling along ridge-lines and avoid slopes below cornices. See a blog post regarding cornices <a href=""http://www.nwac.us/blog/2017/03/14/Cornices/"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Avoid unsupported slopes with overhanging blocks of snow and smooth rock underneath. Glide avalanches are difficult to predict and can release at any time, not just during the heat of the day.</p>

<p>Note that this forecast applies up to the Cascade crest level and does not apply to higher elevations on Mt Hood.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Saturday:</h2>
                <p>Increasing clouds Saturday with light rain and snow developing in the afternoon. Only very light amounts of precipitation if any are expected during the daylight hours Saturday.</p>

<p>Loose wet avalanches should be possible on solar slopes. Filtered sun and rapid daytime warming can quickly melt nighttime surface crusts and rapidly activate loose-wet snow and result in an increase in avalanche danger.  Watch for surface wet snow deeper than a few inches, pinwheels and initial small loose wet avalanches that indicate an increasing loose wet avalanche danger.</p>

<p>New or recent wind slabs are mainly expected in steep lee terrain above treeline, though expected to be less reactive by Saturday. NWAC stations on Mt Hood have had moderate to very strong westerly winds on Wednesday and Thursday. So wind slabs are most likely on NW to SE aspects, but watch for firmer wind transported snow that is a sign of wind slab on other aspects in areas of varied terrain.</p>

<p>Cornices are still large, so give them a wide safety margin. Natural cornice releases and resulting slab avalanches are dangerous and unpredictable. Give potential cornices a wide berth if traveling along ridge-lines and avoid slopes below cornices. See a blog post regarding cornices <a href=""http://www.nwac.us/blog/2017/03/14/Cornices/"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Avoid unsupported slopes with overhanging blocks of snow and smooth rock underneath. Glide avalanches are difficult to predict and can release at any time, not just during the heat of the day.</p>

<p>Note that this forecast applies up to the Cascade crest level and does not apply to higher elevations on the volcanoes.</p>

<p>A brief break in precipitation is expected in most areas through early afternoon with gradual warming. Light precipitation at further warming expected later Saturday afternoon spreading from south to north. The warming temperatures Saturday should allow for any recent storm snow to continue to settle in place and stabilize. Only light amounts of precipitation are expected during daylight hours and should appreciably affect the avalanche danger.</p>

<p>Old wet snow conditions should persist, however, and maintain the potential for glide avalanches on steep unsupported terrain features that may not have released during the recent heavy rains. </p>

<p>The old wet snowpack should continue to drain and stabilize and slowly re-freeze Saturday, especially at higher elevations. </p>

<p>Watch for the numerous re-emerging ground hazards, such as open creeks, shallowly covered rocks and trees, creating poor and challenging travel conditions, especially below treeline.</p>

<p>Remember that closed ski areas without avalanche mitigation are equivalent to backcountry terrain!  </p>

The Mt Hood weather stations received over 5 inches of rain since Monday morning, reaching well above the Cascade crest level.</p>, '\n\n', <p>No recent avalanche observations have been received from the Mt Hood area, however the warming and rain initially triggered numerous wet snow and glide avalanches earlier this week in the WA Cascades, mostly reported on Tuesday and Wednesday, especially on steep unsupported slopes and rock faces where many glide avalanches released. </p>, '\n\n', <p>Rain has now melted significant snow with average snow depths decreasing about 50-60% since Monday! This has allowed much of the previously well snow covered terrain to open with many creeks and snow bridges re-appearing, especially near and below treeline. </p>, '\n\n', <p>Cooling since Thursday with additional, mostly light precipitation, has begun to add some new snow above the old wet snowpack.

Most of the observed recent wet snow or glide avalanches were estimated to be two or more days old. The most recent storm snow, up to about 6 inches, was reluctant to release on steep test slopes with storm layers appearing to rapidly settle with near freezing temperatures. No direct observations were made above treeline.</p>, '\n\n', <p>In the Alpental Valley, a similar story is told with evidence of numerous glide avalanche releases from steep unsupported terrain and rock faces.

<p>Wet snow conditions will persist, maintaining the potential for glide avalanches on steep unsupported terrain features that may not have released during recent heavy rains. Much of the below treeline elevation band does not have enough snow cover to support an avalanche hazard.</p>

                <p>On Wednesday, a shortwave ridge moves across the Pacific Northwest with a temporary decrease in winds and precipitation. This weather should generally allow new or recent storm and wind slab layers to begin stabilizing.</p>

<p>Watch for storm slabs in areas that received more than a few hours of moderate or heavy snowfall intensities, likely near Washington Pass.</p>

<p>Watch for firmer wind-transported snow on lee slopes near ridges, generally northwest through southeast aspects, but watch for it on other aspects in areas of more complex terrain.</p>

<p>Storm or wind slab avalanches may entrain recent snow down to the firmer refreezing snow from last week.</p>

<p>Clearing on Sunday night may have created the conditions for near-surface faceting or surface hoar. If present, storm and wind slab layers may be more reactive than anticipated, particularly in wind-sheltered areas.</p>

<p>Although they will not be listed as avalanche problems, loose dry avalanches are possible Wednesday, particularly on steep slopes. Watch for potential loose wet avalanches on steep, solar slopes mainly in the South Cascades if there are significant mid-day sun breaks.</p>

<p>Watch for the numerous travel hazards such as open creeks, barely buried rocks and trees, creating poor and challenging travel conditions, especially below treeline. </p>

<p>The avalanche danger should generally decrease for all elevation bands on Wednesday.</p>

                <p>On Wednesday night, high pressure should allow for further stabilizing of recent storm and wind slab layers. </p>

<p>A weak to moderate front should move across the Mt Hood area near midday Thursday, causing a period of moderate to briefly heavy snow and moderate ridge level winds. This weather should build new areas of storm and wind slabs, especially in <gs class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"" ginger_software_uiphraseguid=""bb0ef1f7-09a3-45da-a0e6-5b6ad98fd85d"" id=""d2faca6b-9d65-44f2-ba9b-be914bbb2fa6"">wind</gs> affected terrain, such as higher elevations and near ridges.</p>

<p>Watch for storm slabs in areas that received more than a few hours of moderate or heavy snowfall intensities. </p>

<p>Watch for firmer wind-transported snow on lee slopes near ridges, generally northwest through southeast aspects, but expect wind deposited snow on a variety of aspects in areas of more complex terrain.</p>

<p>Storm or wind slab avalanches may entrain recent snow down to the firmer old <gs class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"" ginger_software_uiphraseguid=""bb14dd2b-853b-4c4b-bf85-431d634e89ea"" id=""7c3bb322-ade8-4197-b507-ed876a80c57a"">refreezing</gs> snow from last week.</p>

<p>Although not  listed as a current avalanche problem, loose dry avalanches are possible Thursday, particularly on steep slopes. </p>

<p>Watch for the numerous travel hazards such as open creeks, barely buried rocks and trees, creating poor and challenging travel conditions, especially below treeline. </p>

<p>The avalanche danger should generally increase for all elevation bands on Thursday.</p>

Alpine winds generally out of the SW will increase late Thursday night and stay elevated through Friday. New and generally shallow storm snow instabilities may develop in the Mt.

<p>Wind slab is the most likely avalanche problem to encounter on Friday, with deeper and potentially more sensitive slabs possible in the Mt. Baker area. Use caution and watch for firmer wind-transported snow on lee slopes near ridges, generally northwest through southeast aspects, but expect wind deposited snow on a variety of aspects in areas of more complex terrain.</p>

                <p>Light to moderate showers Saturday and Saturday night should give way to light showers on Sunday. Increasing moderate WNW winds are expected on Sunday and should be capable of transporting snow, especially near ridges and exposed terrain. See the NWAC mountain weather forecast tab for more details. </p>

<p>Five to ten inches of new snow Saturday to Sunday morning should be sufficient for the development of new areas of storm slab. Increasing winds should transport this new and older snow and create pockets of wind slab, particularly near ridges and on NW through S aspects.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Monday:</h2>
                <p>Sunny weather should be seen on Monday with light northwest winds and recent snow layers continuing to stabilize. </p>

<p>Wind slab is replacing storm slab as our primary avalanche problem as storm snow will be more rapidly stabilizing.</p>

<p>Small to large wind slabs should remain most likely on NW through E aspects on Monday and should become more stubborn or difficult to trigger. Watch for areas of firmer, wind-transported snow, mainly on lee terrain features. </p>

<p>Storm slab layers in the upper snowpack are still giving test results at multiple locations along the west slopes of the Cascades on Sunday. These layers should continue to heal on Monday, but may still be present in areas that had rapidly accumulating snow the past couple of days.</p>

<p>Wind and storm slab will be most likely in the Northwest Zone at Mt. Baker, where snowfall has been heaviest. Note that we have been through a heavy loading period in the Mt. Baker area and a lack of observations in the above tree line zone, makes conditions there more uncertain.</p>

<p>Loose dry avalanches are not listed as an avalanche problem type, but continue to watch for loose dry snow on steep terrain, where even a small avalanche of this type may be dangerous above terrain traps or where early season hazards exist.</p>

<p>Travel with a partner and keep them in sight and in communication in areas where there has been recent heavy snowfall due to tree well danger.</p>

<p>Remember that early season terrain hazards still exist, such as poorly covered rocks, vegetation and creeks, particularly at lower elevations.</p>

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Wednesday:</h2>
                <p>Continued sunny and mild weather is expected Wednesday with some moderate to strong crest level easterly winds.</p>

<p>This should allow for further settlement of the recent storm layers and cause an overall slowly decreasing danger. </p>

<p>Small wind slabs may exist on a variety of aspects, mainly on exposed lee slopes receiving any transported snow. The warming surface snow should limit or end further transport. Any remaining wind slabs are expected to be stubborn or difficult to trigger. Watch for small areas of firmer, wind-transported snow on isolated, lee terrain features.</p>

<p>Continue to watch for isolated, small, loose wet avalanches on steep sun exposed terrain during the late morning or afternoon, especially on unsupported slopes or near rocks.</p>

<p>Early season terrain hazards still exist, such as poorly covered rocks, vegetation and creeks, particularly at lower elevations.</p>

Moderate cool offshore flow (easterlies) on Tuesday and Wednesday have locally suppressed temperatures in the Cascades Passes and the Crystal area while areas further west (Baker, Paradise) warmed significantly on Wednesday. This has also allowed for gradual snowpack settlement. </p>, '\n\n', <p>Active wind loading has been most pronounced in the Mt.

These were small and isolated to features near ridges, causing terrain choices to be altered to avoid exposure to obvious wind loaded pockets. By afternoon, surface snow had become moist on any solar facing slopes, from E-SW, ending further wind transport.</p>, '\n\n', <p>Wind transported snow was a different story in the Paradise area on Tuesday. A snowboarder triggered a wind slab on a westerly aspect of Panorama Point that ran about 250 vertical feet and had some larger blocks in the debris pile (see picture below). A natural loose wet avalanche was also reported in the same area on a steep solar aspect and ran roughly 200 feet. By Wednesday NPS rangers had observed the path has already filled back in due to ongoing transport by east winds. Significant wind transport was also reported in the nearby Tatoosh range and wind effect was noted down to the Paradise parking lot.  </p>, '\n\n', <p>Crystal patrol on Wednesday reported east winds has stripped snow along windward ridges but little snow remained for significant transport. Settled powder remained on northerly aspects not wind buffed. </p>, '\n\n', <p><em>Photo Seth Waterfall NPS, MRNP Panorama Point on 12-6-17.

                <h2>Detailed Forecast for Thursday:</h2>
                <p>Continued sunny and mild weather is expected Thursday with crest level easterly winds decreasing significantly Wednesday night and becoming light SW by Thursday afternoon.  However moderate Pass level easterlies are expected to continue through the day Thursday, only easing later in the afternoon. In general, maximum temperatures will be several degrees warmer than Wednesday with a few NWAC stations outside the Cascade Passes likely pushing past 50 degrees on Thursday afternoon.</p>

<p>Loose wet avalanches, natural or human triggered and on steep solar aspects will be the top avalanche problem in the Mt. Baker area on Thursday. Be wary of even small loose wet avalanches around terrain traps. Stubborn wind slab may exist in specific locations near and above treeline in this zone.   </p>

<p>A variety of snow surfaces now exist due to local wind, sun and temperature effects.  Early season terrain hazards still exist, such as poorly covered rocks, vegetation and creeks, particularly at lower elevations.</p>
